            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If all ſhould be admitted to the Sacrament of the Supper, ſurely Chriſt would not onely have admitted his Diſciples and baulk'd them in the ſame houſe, ſure he would have bid his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>go and give my ſupper to all Nations,</hi> ſurely the Apoſtle would not have bidden men <hi>examine themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Ordination</hi> be not Jeſus Chriſts Ordinance for ordaining Goſpell preachers and Officers, why did the Apoſtles uſe it, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. why did God call for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. why is <hi>Titus left in Crete</hi> for that purpoſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.3. why was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> ordained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14, and commanded not to lay on hands ſuddenly: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 22.</p>
            <p>There are ſome others, who acknowledge a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to be the Ordinance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that <hi>Preaching</hi> is their worke, but thinke that any others, though not Miniſters, may Preach publikely and conſtantly.

            <p n="5">5. A Fifth and great reaſon was, my conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Foundation upon which he built his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> which I humbly conceive is rotten: it ſeemes to be this. <hi>That all the Saints of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpirit of God, which is the ſpirit of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, dwelling in them, they are forthwith enabled in ſome degree or other to underſtand the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Scripture ſo farre as to be able to deliver it, and Preach, and apply it to others.</hi> This made me more willing to undertake it, that I might ſpeake ſomething in the Vindication of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God ſo much this day abuſed: It is one of the moſt dangerous things the Scripture tels us of, either to deny the true and proper
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118462:8"/> workings of the Spirit of God, or to force any thing upon it; both of theſe ſinners blaſpheme in a very high nature.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be loth to come within a ſuſpition of denying any influence of the holy Spirit, I am ſenſible how ſad a guilt they come under that ſay, that he that caſts out Devils by the <hi>power of God doth it by the Prince of Devils.</hi> But I perſwade my ſelfe that there is not a greater cheat under Heaven this day, by which poore Chriſtians are deceived, and doe deceive them by <hi>pretences of the Spirit;</hi> give me leave therefore to ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this ſo neceſſary a Theme.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt I take it for granted, <hi>that the ſoules of the moſt holy ſervants of God under Heaven,</hi> may be under temptations and <hi>prevail'd upon by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe was tempted, which of his ſervants then can thinke to be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? and being lyable to Satans temptations are capable of receiving impreſſions from him. Now</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is nothing more certaine then that <hi>Satan is in all things (ſo farre as his power extends) an exact imitator of God and his ſpirit,</hi> that look as the holy Spirit of God workes, ſo the Devill will endeavour to worke alſo, mocking the holy Spirit as the <hi>Magicians did Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Both the holy and evill ſpirit agree in this, that they both worke, <hi>per modum afflatus,</hi> as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits worke, by making inward impreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirit of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As the Spirit of God dwelleth in the Saints and

If we be in the darke, as to an action, we may go ſeeke God, that his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would ſhew us his rule in his word, but I would never truſt any voyce of the Spirit that ſhould not be ſeconded by the word, though I could ſee nothing in the word plainely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me.</p>

            <p>Nor may the heterogeneus nonſenſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture, which come in theſe dayes from many that pretend to be Saints, be with leſs blaſphemy father'd upon the Spirit of God; I come therefore now cloſer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſpeake of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> how far it aſſiſts the Servants of God, in the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and how a man may be knowne to have had his guidance in interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Gods moſt holy Spirit, in order to which obſerve as truths.</p>

            <p>That <hi>this guift is not common to all Saints by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſpirit given them, viz. the ſanctifying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but onely given by the uſe of meanes, by the ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, weighing the Originall, conſidering paralell Scriptures, weighing coherences and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> ſtill it will follow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thoſe onely may preach who are enabled to doe this, who can ſearch the Originals, conſider paralell Scriptures, and judge if they be paralells; who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and weigh coherences and conſequences, &amp;c.</hi> and this would argue very few guifted men fitting. Being neither:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inabled <hi>to allow themſelves times to do it,</hi> nor yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Having naturall or acquired abilities to do it,</hi> if they had time; therefore it ſtood Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> in hand to maintaine the other notions: <hi>That they have an immediate aſſiſtance to it by the Spirit, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them as Saints.</hi> An opinion as much ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as dangerous; for if this were true, then as I have urged,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118462:18"/>1. <hi>None but ſuch, as have the ſpirit thus dwelling in them and are Saints, could give a true interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any portion,</hi> the contrary to which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>No Saint could erre, in any interpretation of Scripture or application of it;</hi> why? becauſe this act of his proceeds from the immediate vertue of an unerring Spirit. Thus ſhould nonſenſicall and ridiculous interpretations of Scripture, which he that runs may read to be falſe, be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon the ſpirit of God. And herein (Chriſtians) I cannot but obſerve how God hath made Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> to confute himſelfe; for you ſhal any of ye be Judges, whether an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Spirit guided him when he interpreted James 4.5. to be the holy Spirit dwelling in us, and applied it to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And the like I might ſay of forty Scriptures he hath brought and applyed in his Booke, that have no kind of relation to the thing, he brings them to prove; take his Booke, examine the Scriptures he quotes, well obſerving for what he quotes them, and thou wilt finde it very true. Now I thinke it were no leſſe then blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for me to bring James 4.5. <hi>The Spirit that dwells in us luſteth to envy,</hi> to prove that the holy Spirit dwells in the Saints, if I ſhould ſay, <hi>The ſpirit guided me to that interpretation;</hi> Beſides,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of neceſſity: A Saint (if this Doctrine be true) <hi>can never alter his opinion</hi> in any one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures interpretation, for ſurely the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not guide a man contrary to its owne former guidance.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118462:19"/>4. <hi>If this guift comes from the ſpirit as the ſpirit that dwells in us; Every one in whom the ſpirit dwells muſt be able to expound Scripture to others.</hi> In ſhort, Chriſtians, ſo many groſſe abſurdities would follow this poſition as would eaſily evidence it to be as farre from truth as hell is from heaven. And yet if our brethren cannot ſay this, they can ſay nothing at all to juſtifie their abilities to expound Scriptures, and ſo conſequently their practice in it.</p>
            <p>Now that I might vindicate the holy Spirit from being the author of thoſe lamentable wreſtings of Scripture, nonſenſicall interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and abſurd ſenſes which many put upon it, I have undertaken this diſcourſe, one thing more eſpecially moving me.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The dangerous conſequences, which, I apprehend, would be of this opinion and practice, and eſpecially at this time,</hi> I ſhall mention but a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A dangerous <hi>puffing up of Chriſtians,</hi> with the opinion of their own parts and abilities, no Schollers are ſo proud as thoſe that have leaſt Scholerſhip;<note place="margin">Hoc tantum ſcio me nihil ſcire. Non eſt calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſior homo in terris quam ſuperbus Doctor, Rex, Princeps. <hi>Lutherus.</hi>
               </note> men of knowledge ſee ſuch a vaſt knowledge before them, that it makes them cry out, they know nothing, nor any Chriſtian ſo ready to be puft up with a conceit of their own knowledge as thoſe that know leaſt; thoſe that have rare abilities to expound Scripture ſee ſo many difficulties, and meet with ſo many conſiderable queſtions and objections, that it makes them judge themſelves very inſufficient to this great work, <hi>who is ſufficient for ſuch things?</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118462:19"/> obſerve (Chriſtians) where there are ſuch prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whether thou doeſt not ordinarily ſee them men puft up with ſelfe conceit and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of themſelves, thinking no texts too hard for them to open, no difficulties too hard to unty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We live in an age when the worſt of men are much prejudiced againſt the wayes of God and his Goſpell Ordinances, and in which many ſuch men there are that are very learned and criticall.</hi> Now whether this be a probable way to ingratiate the Ordinances of God to people, to ſend out Preachers, that through want of abilities ſhall make the Ordinances of God nauſeous to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hearts, let any prudent Chriſtians Judge. Surely in ſuch times thoſe ſhould be ſent out who are of moſt eminent <hi>Abilities,</hi> and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed even with humane Art, to perſwade in the moſt moving way, and to inſinuate themſelves into the hearts of their hearers, otherwiſe the Ordinances of God ſhall yet be made more contemptible. And for ordinary people, how much they are prejudiced againſt the wayes of God, all know; and whether it be a way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Goſpell of Chriſt amongſt them, to ſend out ſuch whom they have formerly known to be of their own ranke or below them, let experience witneſſe; when Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe (who ſurely had better guifts then our brethren have) preached where the people could ſay, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters ſon? the ſon of Mary, the brother of James and Joſes, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118462:20"/> of Judas and Simon, and are not his ſiſters here with us?</hi> Mar. 6.3. It is ſaid v. 5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt could do there no mighty workes,</hi> ſave that he <hi>laid his hands upon a few ſick perſons and healed them,</hi> whereupon he <hi>went downe into the Villages and preach't;</hi> and ſhall we thinke they are likely to be great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in doing good? When the people ſhall ſay, <hi>Is not this the Cobler that mended our boots the other day?</hi> or rather will it not be a way to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den people in their contempt of the Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, doe we not live in a time, <hi>when Chriſtians are growne to a very high degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ordinary notions will not ſerve their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous palats,</hi> They muſt have good ſauſe as well as meat, and all that Miniſters can doe by their moſt elaborate judicious Sermons is ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep alive in Chriſtians a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ordinances; and will it not be a ready meanes to make them wholly to ſlight them, to have their eares continually tyred with raw, and <hi>indigeſted Notions</hi> and <hi>vaine tautologies,</hi> with diſcourſes in which ſhall be nothing to win the affections,<note place="margin">Doctores non ſolum aedificare, ſed etiam deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere debent.

            <p n="4">4. Doe we not live in times in which the <hi>Socinian and Arminian hereſies are ſpread over the Nation; that there is ſcarce any body of profeſſors but ſome or other of them are poyſoned with this leaven?</hi> And is this a time to ſend out ſuch woodden inſtruments to deale with them? will a guifted brother that hath no learning, nor any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his reaſon be able to graple w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a ſubtil

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Will not this practice make way to render the office of the Miniſtry uſeleſſe, and the Ordinance of Ordination uſeleſſe?</hi> For to what purpoſe ſhould theſe continue, if it be every ones duty to Preach as well as they; nay, &amp; in time thus ſhall all the Ordinances of God be made uſeleſſe, for they that bring arguments to prove this, may if they will bring better from this conceſſion to prove they may baptize and give the Lords Supper, and then what need of officers for any?</p>
            <p>I might inſtance in many more, but in ſhort my apprehenſions are ſuch, that I believe, if the Devill were to aſke a Courteſie of a State, he ſhould aſke no more then, 1. <hi>An univerſall tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and 2. <hi>an uncontrouled liberty for every one to Preach</hi> and expound Scriptures.</p>
            <p>By an <hi>univerſall toleration</hi> he ſhould get a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for his friends he hath already;<note place="margin">By the firſt the divel would ſecure his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from the Sword of the Magiſtrates; by the ſecond from ſword of argument, the two edged ſword of the word.</note> by this <hi>libertas prophetandi</hi> he would make more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men wreſting the Scriptures to their owne deſtruction, and the deſtruction of them that heare him. If he could but procure theſe two things, he ſhould have the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> in a ſnare for neglect of their duty in <hi>reference</hi> to the <hi>truth and glory and ordinance of</hi> Chriſt, he would have the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> under his feet (thoſe great troublers of his Kingdome) yea and the third part of the ſtarres of Heaven would be drawne downe, being by this meanes ſeduced into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or carried up above ordinances, and he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118462:21"/> would harden the hearts of others againſt the meanes of Grace. My ſoule trembles to thinke what the iſſue of <hi>Either</hi> or <hi>both theſe</hi> will be. The Purity and truth of Ordinances would be loſt, and the power of Godlineſſe loſt too. I ſay the firſt will be loſt; the <hi>Ordinance of Ordination gone?</hi> have we been ſo zealous againſt a trifling ceremony, Chriſtians, becauſe it hath not been commanded, and ſhall it be now ſo light a thing to us to make the commands of the Goſpell (yea ſo many as are for ordination) of no effect? Have we ſtrained at a Gnat, &amp; ſhall we ſwallow theſe Camels? have we been ſo zealous againſt an Apocryphall <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> and ſhal we ſo tamely admit thoſe things which are far more <hi>Apocryphall?</hi> ſhall any dare to ſay that a private Perſons ſprinkling water upon the face, and naming the holy Trinity is that Ordinance of Baptiſme? or the breaking a bit of Bread, and powring out a little Wine (uſing the words of adminiſtration) by the ſame hand, the great Ordinance of the Lords Supper? and is their prophecying (as they call it) any more the <hi>great Ordinance of Preaching?</hi> no ſure, thus ſhall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be all one after another laid aſide. And for the <hi>power of godlineſſe</hi> (deare Chriſtians!) looke into other places where there hath beene an <hi>univerſall toleration,</hi> and ſee how much of it thou findeſt there. In ſhort, Chriſtians, you can remember the time when the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Preach'd the Goſpell power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainely; and Chriſtians heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118462:21"/> and humbly, and were wont in their families to repeat and examine Sermons, to ſearch the Scriptures for the truth of thoſe things which the Miniſters ſaid, were not the Chriſtians of thoſe times <hi>noble Bereans?</hi> did not the power of Godlineſſe thrive under this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? were there not more ſoules converted by farre then now; were not thoſe Chriſtians more humble, ſincere, cordiall, united, ſound Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then thoſe of our times? had we not more Chriſtians when we had fewer Preachers? and ſince this unbridled liberty hath beene taken, have not Chriſtians beene more looſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, more crotchicall, and ſcepticks rather then Chriſtians? O that the Lord would pleaſe to teach his people ſobriety to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>budding rods,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>he doth not make to bloſſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe (Chriſtians!) I was the unfitteſt of ten thouſand to undertake this great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, not onely in reſpect of my few dayes and little abilities of learning and Judgement, but in regard of my much work, it is now but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes ſince this Authors Booke came to my ſight or hands, and I have had the taſke of ſeven Sermons to ſtudy and Preach in the time, ſo that thou canſt not expect I ſhould have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved my ſelf very exact in my anſwer, which was diſpatched in ten dayes (my Preface ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken up the other foure.) But I could not hold my peace (not for my <hi>owne</hi> ſake) for I durſt have truſted the weakeſt judgements to

And now I beſeech you (deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious friends) in this day of reproach, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the ordinance of the Lord Jeſus. This Gentleman hath ſo farre appeared for the Lord as to plead with people to maintaine the <hi>great Ordinance of the Miniſtry.</hi> The Lord make him in that to prevaile with them. Severall things the Devill hath deviſed in theſe ſinfull times to prejudice the Spirits of Chriſtians againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpell that are the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Lord to their ſoules,<note place="margin">Non amo te Sabidi nec poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum dicere qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: Hoc tantum poſſum d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I ſay ſome things there are that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hath put into ſome profeſſors mouths to defend their revilings of them, and ſhamefull contempt caſt upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>They are diſaffected to the State,</hi> I could not but obſerve this great ſubtilty of Satan, when Church differences through much wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and many diſputes were almoſt brought
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118462:22"/> together to finde out this <hi>new way to divide.</hi> But my deare friends! is this enough thinke you, to juſtifie not hearing the Miniſters of the Goſpel, or laying them aſide. Bleſſed be God that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy cauſe of diviſion is almoſt now taken away. But was there nothing that in poynt of conſcience might ſtumble the Miniſters of God in reference to our great change? or were all Saints that were moſt complying? I ſpeake not for my ſelfe, I confeſſe I was from the firſt more ſatisfied in poynt of Engaging, then many of my <hi>Reverend fathers,</hi> but I could not but from the firſt thinke, and ſtill doe thinke hundreds of them that durſt not, were more conſcientious then my ſelfe, and had the feare of God more upon them then my ſinfull ſoule hath, and were I either in Parliament or Army, I truſt I ſhould the more love and honour that man for ever, whom I ſhould obſerve holy and conſcientious in all his wayes for oppoſing me, and venturing any frownes to doe it, where he obſerved me doing any thing that he in conſcience ſhould thinke I did amiſſe in, though I were fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied I did not. But I hope that buſineſſe is determined by the great God, O that no grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for differences relating to it might yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, but that there might be in all that feare the Lord an heart of Oblivion as well as <hi>an Act of Oblivion</hi> is paſt in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second great objection againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is: <hi>they are Preſbyterians,</hi> and the Devill hath ſo far prevailed with many as to make it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118462:23"/> in their hearts <hi>Anathema eſſe Preſbyterum.</hi> It hath beene the lot of the Saints heretofore to be ſtigmatized with Apocryphall names, <hi>Lollards, Hugonites, Calviniſts, Puritanes, Non conformiſts,</hi> yet they <hi>bare their names</hi> with <hi>Glorying,</hi> becauſe it was for the Lords ſake. Bleſſed be God that he hath now taught our enemies a <hi>Scripture name: Presbyter</hi> is a name of the Lords owne coyning. Tit. 1.5. 1 Pet. 5.1. 2 Ep. Jo. v. 1. 3 Ep. v. 1. &amp;c. I confeſſe Chriſtians that name next the name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is my glory, and the next <hi>Scripture name</hi> for the Miniſters of the Goſpell and officers of the Church. After that way which they call <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> I deſire to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Goſpell-order.</hi> And if this be to be vile, we muſt be more vile: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but looke upon <hi>Paſtors, Elders, and Deacons,</hi> to be the Church officers under the Goſpell, and thinke that the government of the <hi>Church is to be in ſuch hands,</hi> and that <hi>Synods are Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to which Churches ought to be ſubject,</hi> and that errors <hi>and hereticks are not to be endured, nor</hi> publike Ordinances to be adminiſtred by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands, nor the <hi>great Ordinance of the ſupper to be given out promiſcuouſly,</hi> and theſe are the great things that Preſbyterians differ in, both from ſome of their diſſenting brethren, and the Epiſcopall party; and whether this charge will be enough to juſtifie your hatred of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell, and dividings from them in the day of the Lord Jeſus (Chriſtians!)

               <p>THe Author is pleaſed in the firſt Chapter to tell us, that he grants theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> that there are or ought to be in all the Churches of Chriſt regularly conſtituted, certain Officers call'd Preachers, Paſtors, Teachers, or Elders, &amp;c.</q> Eph. 4.11, 12. 1 Cor. 12.29, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2.

               </p>
               <p>So that he grants the Goſpel rule for Goſpel Preachers to be that thoſe that take the Office upon them ſhould be ſolemnly ſet a part by <hi>faſting and prayer, and impoſition of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>
                     <hi>3.</hi> That theſe officers are to be heard, acknowledged, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, honoured, maintained, countenanced, and furthered in their office by the people.</q> 1 Theſ. 5 12. Eph. 5.21, &amp;c.</p>

Matth. 28.20. Rom. 10.17.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the cloſe of that Chapter he ſaies:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We utterly diſlike therefore all opinions and practiſes that tend to the derogation or prejudice of this Office, Ordinance, and Miniſtry, which muſt be kept ſafe, and untouched; and we may not endure it to be ſpoken againſt. Thus much we grant to the Preachers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(Sir,) Although we believe that Gods word doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to believe and grant this, and all this: yet we have cauſe to thank you, that in this erronious and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding age (wherein ſo many have loſt their <hi>firſt love</hi>) you will thus far bear witneſſe to the truth of God. This is much more then thoſe that uſually handle your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will grant: and I ſuppoſe enough (if well improved) to bring you to cloſe with that other piece of truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which you contend, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Publique preaching the Goſpel amongſt profeſſors is a proper and diſtinct act of theſe Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſecond Chapter you come to tell us, what we have granted you, and there you confeſſe we grant you twelve things.</p>
               <p n="1">"1. <hi>That ſuch as have not been brought up in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or want School-learning, may (being duely called) become publique preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed I have granted, in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> p. 14. but in theſe terms onely: that School-learning <hi>is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</hi> So that doubtleſſe in <hi>caſes of neceſſity,</hi> when the Church of God cannot be ſupplied enough with men of learning, this may be done (and I conceive this is our caſe and part now) for truly, I judge a godly gifted man, duely ordained and ſet a part to the work (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned in part) farre fitter for the Miniſtry then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118462:27"/> wretch (though the greateſt Scholler in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.<note place="margin">Quoniam non omnibus forte etiam nullis ea donorum ubertas obtingit a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu, quae Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolis. Nulla fuerit impietas quod donis illius diminutum eſt ſupplere diſciplinarum adminiculis Eraſmus. <hi>in Eccleſiaſt. edit. Froben. An. 1554.</hi> Hodie quum pluſquam neceſſaria fit linguarum cognitio, &amp; Deus hoc tempore mirabile beneficio eas ex tenebris in lucem eruerit ſunt nunc magni theologi qui fuoioſè adverſas eas declamitent quum certum ſit ſpiritum ſanctum eterno elogio hic ornaſſe linguas, colligere promptum eſt quonum ſpiritu agantur iſti cenſores. <hi>Calu. in c. 4. 1. ep. ad Corin.</hi>
                  </note>) Thus far now this is granted. Yet withall I cannot think that God would have ſupplied miraculouſly the firſt preachers of the Goſpel with an extraordinary gift of tongues; and an infallible ſpirit in expounding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: if he had not in his wiſdome thought that it was moſt fitting for one that were learned in the Originall Tongues to interpret Scripture publiquely.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing you ſay we grant is,
<q>That the Ceremony of impoſition of hands is not neceſſary to the making of a Miniſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But who hath granted this I know not. I have not, for p. 76. I ſay, that <hi>I cannot think it can be omitted without ſin in an ordinary orderly ordination:</hi> and I give reaſons for it. Nor can I finde any place where my reverend brother, Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> hath been ſo free in granting away Scripture precepts. Nor is it much conſiderable who hath granted it; for who ever they are, they have granted away a truth was not theirs to diſpoſe of. The word of God hath not granted it; and we cannot grant you away any piece of that, unleſſe you can bring us a ticket under <hi>Chriſts</hi> hand. Nay, you your ſelfe will not grant it, for <hi>p.</hi> 2. you ſay, they <hi>muſt be ſet apart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non eſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum iota legis à quo non màgni montes pendent.</note> according to the Goſpel rule. Now what that is, you tell us, 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> And Acts 13.3. To the Law, and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, (Sir,) <hi>Iſ.</hi> 8.20. Except we could finde ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations there, without this we cannot make ſo ſlight a buſineſſe of it, eſpecially when the holy Ghoſt layeth ſo much weight upon it as to expreſſe the whole ordinance of ordination by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing you ſay was granted is,
<q>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118462:27"/>That ſuch as intend the miniſtry, and are to be ſet apart for it, may as probationers preach publikely, and that Batchelours of Art may common-place in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to the end that their Abilities may be tried and judged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed is granted you by Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pulpit guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded p. 4. <hi>Vindiciae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.</hi> 17. <hi>V.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Due Right p. 281. 305.</note> and by my ſelfe, upon that ground of Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. yet not without due limitation. 1. As <hi>Probationers.</hi> 2. <hi>Before the Elders, or the Church</hi> in which he is conſtantly to preach. So Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> limits it.) I have added, 3. <hi>Not without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Presbytery</hi> that is to ordain him. 4. <hi>Not to make a work of it,</hi> but to doe it ſome few times. And (Sir) theſe are Scripture bounds. For the text onely ſayes,<note place="margin">A minori ad majus affirman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</note> 
                  <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on none,</hi> and <hi>Let him be firſt proved</hi> (which is ſpoken of Deacons, but holds <hi>a fortiori,</hi> to preachers. So that all his preaching muſt be in order to a <hi>proof,</hi> and a ſecuring of <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>laying on hands ſuddenly.</hi> Now (Sir) the means muſt be proportionate to the end; Reaſon tels you with theſe limitations, it is granted, ſir.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay we grant, that <hi>ordaining is not the onely thing neceſſary.</hi> We grant it indeed, for there muſt be before this <hi>miniſteriall gifts,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. and an <hi>inclination to the work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>
                     <hi>5. We doe grant you,</hi> That in extraordinary caſes, as when no regular ordination can be had, nor any poſſibility of obtaining it, as in caſe of perſecution, or the like; or when people are diſperſed into Countries, where no Miniſter can be had, or where a Church is to be planted amongſt Infidels; and ſo in the infancy of the Church. Alſo in the corrupted collapſed eſtate, &amp; generall diſorder of a Church. So when the Church is in any danger; as in caſe of lack of a Pilat or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when the ſhip is in danger, or the Souldiers aſſaulted, the Marriners or Souldiers may appoint a Captaine or Maſter of the ſhip: ſo may the people in theſe and ſuch like caſes ſet apart, and appoint one of themſelves to this office, and here (as they ſay) God doth call immediately and extraordinarily.</q>

Yea, you reckon one too many. For ſuppoſe a <hi>Church be to be planted amongst Infidels,</hi> I thinke Gods way is the beſt way to doe it in. So it was <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3, 4, 5: he did not ſend meerly gifted perſons to doe it, but calls from Heaven to his Church to ſet a part <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> before they went; which they did by faſting and prayer, and laying on of hands: yet both of them were extraordinarily gifted. Indeed if ſuch ordination cannot be had) we grant it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſay we grant, <hi>That every private man may in his "own family read and apply to his own family ſomething from the letter of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Expounding is not a proper terme for their ablities. Otherwiſe we grant it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You ſay truely we grant, <q>That any private Chriſtian may privately and occaſionally, exhort, teach, admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or comfort his brother.</q>

               <p>THis Gentleman comes now to his third Chapter, and in that, having already ſhewed wherein we agree both, he comes to ſtate the buſineſſe in difference.</p>
               <p>And in his firſt lines, he ſayes right that the Preachers doe affirm (yea, and muſt ſtand to that affirmation too) till better arguments be brought us, then this book will afford us)
<q>That private perſons (though gifted and called,<note place="margin">Queſtion ſtat.</note>

               </p>
               <p>My brother <hi>Hall</hi> puts in a <hi>Call.</hi> I balk't that word pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, becauſe I knew what our brethren call a <hi>Call,</hi> and I meant ſomething more.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:118462:29"/>
               <p>This point (ſaith this Gentleman) <hi>The people deny and oppoſe.</hi> (That's no great matter, if they cannot diſprove it. But in order to the mannaging of their oppoſition, he brings us ten poſitions (which he calls truths) which well proved, he thinks will guard this priviledge.</p>
               <p>I hope he intends them not for a <hi>Life-guard</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended truth; if they were they ſhould ſtand neerer to it. For, for the firſt foure, I will undertake for him, that ſhall oppoſe the intended truth, which chiefely lies in the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh. He ſhall cut the throat of them, if he will, and neither a one of the firſt foure ſhall check him. So the <hi>Van-guard</hi> ſtands for little, but to make a ſhew. Yet it will not be amiſſe to examine theſe (for fear they ſhould have a dagger more then any one ſees) and be more in the Authors meaning, then they are in common view and apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The Vanguard then conſiſts of theſe foure notions. 1. <hi>"That the Scripture doe as well belong to the people, as the Preachers. Quid inde?</hi> what then? or who denies it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>That the people, as well as the Preachers, are to read and ſtudy the Scriptures.</q> God forbid but they ſhould read and ſtudy them; but what of that?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>"That the Expoſition of the Scriptures, as to the right uſe and underſtanding of them, is neceſſary to the people, as well as the preachers.</hi> I obſerve a ſcurvy term, <hi>As well as,</hi> in every propoſition. If there be not a ſnake in that word, I ſee nothing of falſhood in this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>"That the people, as well as Preachers, are to abound in the knowledge of the Scriptures. [As wel as]</hi> again? Surely the <hi>cheat</hi> lies in that terme; we will ſearch it anon. But admit it rightly underſtood.</p>
               <p>After theſe, comes in the Tripartite notion, called, the <hi>priviledge</hi> that ſhould be guarded.</p>

               <p>This I feare will prove anon to be barely proved; yet we dare not limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nor ſay, but that they may have ſometimes been ſo bleſſed: although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you might have left out the word <hi>frequently,</hi> I feare you will want Scripture proofe anon for that word.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV. Wherein</hi> the fifth, and part of the ſixth page is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: and the firſt <hi>propoſition is ſcann'd,</hi> and opened, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scriptures doe as well belong to the people, as the Preachers.</head>
               <p>THe firſt propoſition is, <hi>That that the Scriptures doe as wel "belong to the people, as to the Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This point the Gentleman, firſt <hi>proves.</hi> Secondly, <hi>cleares</hi> from objections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He proves it</hi> (he ſhould have done well to have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it firſt.) Thoſe two terms, 1. <hi>Belong.</hi> 2. <hi>As well as,</hi> are not cleare. We may ſay, the government of the City belongs to the people of it; but how? <hi>quoad exercitium actus?</hi> as to the exerciſe of the acts of government. Are the keys of government theirs? no ſure. Then farewell <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and welcome <hi>Levelling.</hi> But it belongs to them as it is for their good, and peace, and order, as that under which, and according to the rule of which they are to live.</p>
               <p>If this Gentleman means by <hi>belonging,</hi> what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>That the Scriptures are profitable for all, for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good workes.</hi> God forbid but we ſhould grant it; and this <hi>belonging</hi> is proved by <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. and <hi>Iude</hi> 3. and many other places.</p>
               <p>But if this Genleman means, that they ſhould belong to them as the keyes to the Steward, to open and apply them to the people, he both contradicts himſelfe, for he tels us in other places of this book, <hi>That they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118462:30"/> and apply Scriptures authoritatively;</hi> and he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Apoſtle too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.<note place="margin">Myſterium diſtribuimus in verbum Dei &amp; Sacramenta. <hi>P. Martyr ad loc.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> Of which <hi>myſteries</hi> the Goſpell is one, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. And if he doth not meane, that the Scriptures thus belong to the people</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſayes nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2: His ſecond objection is little worth (of which more by and by) for ſuppoſe we argue thus:
<q>If the Scriptures be for the peoples uſe, and belong to them for reproofe, correction, doctrine, inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then the people may expound and preach them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſayes: <q>They are committed to Preachers, and yet not ſo as excluding the people,— But The Preachers are eſpecially,<note place="margin">Natura enim omnes jubet mutuò eſſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodes ac defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores ſalutis noſtrae &amp; alienae, maxime veri fratres. <hi>Pareus.</hi> Immo quod tibi frater eſt &amp; proximus, ideo es illius cuſtos &amp; tibi illius ſalus eſt a deo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendata. <hi>P.

                     </note> and by publique office, and the duty of their place to take care of them; but this hinders not, but that every Chriſtian is by duty bound in generall to take care of the ſoules of his fellow Chriſtians, and ſo of the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We eaſily grant that private Chriſtians are in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bound by the Law of God and nature to take a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate care of their brethrens ſoules and bodies; and of the truth, ſo farre as to keep it in their own hearts, and propagate it in their own families; yea and to admoniſh, reprove, and exhort one another: to watch over them, if ſtanding: if any brother be fallen through infirmity, to endeavour to reſtore him in the ſpirit of meekneſſe. But (Sir) they are not to take a publique care of, nor are they put in a publique truſt concerning their brethrene ſoules. Neither are the Scriptures <hi>committed to them to teach others.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quicquid enim ingenio humano ex cogitatum aſſuitur Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae ut pro di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus revelato habeatur men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium eſt. <hi>Pareus in Apoc. c. 22.</hi>

                  <hi>What the word of God doth not ſay in reference to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and worſhip of God, that we muſt not ſay.</hi> For if we doe we ſhall adde to the Scriptures. God muſt order every pin in the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>But the word of God no where ſaies, that the people
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118462:31"/> have the <hi>glorious Goſpel of God committed to their truſt, to teach others out of it,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. and therefore we muſt not ſay, the people have it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. The Scripture warrants no ſuch ſpeech, it is not the language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And ſo (Sir) in point of publique truſt they are excluded, as much as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Excellency to be <hi>Lord Deputy of Ireland,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes others from being ſo, though it be not ſaid ſo (in the letter) in the Commiſſion. In point of uſe indeed the people are every where included, but they are no where called Stewards, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And (Sir) for your diſtinction between <hi>committed,</hi> and ſo committed, it is <hi>Apocryphall.</hi> The Scripture no where ſayes, they are at all <hi>committed</hi> to them. You muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (Sir) your own marginall note which you give, as p. 29. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi lex non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to juſtifie what you ſay, you tell us that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the people; for, <q>
                     <hi>In 1</hi> Tim. <hi>3.15. the Apoſtle ſaies,</hi> That the whole Church, not the Preachers onely, is the pillar and ground of truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Any one may ſee a <hi>Non ſequitur</hi> (without ſpectacles) in the Argument. And the Gentlemans proofes will none of them prove this, nor any thing like unto it.</p>
               <p>In the next place he comes to cleare his point from two <hi>Objections.</hi> He frames one from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <q>Where the Epiſtles are directed to the Angels. <hi>To this he anſwers: 1.</hi> The Angels are taken collectively for the whole Churches, <hi>as Exod. 4.2.</hi> Iſrael my ſonne. <hi>2. He ſayes, It is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,</hi> Revel. <hi>2.7.</hi> He that hath an eare to beare let him beare what the Spirit ſayes to the Churches.</q> To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Though I ſhould never have made this objection, but think there is very little ſtrength in it, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man onely brought it forth to try his skill about it, yet I conceive his anſwer is too ſhort in it: and ſeeing the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is weake, it is charity for diſputation ſake to take its part.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:118462:31"/>1. <hi>It will hardly be proved, that Angel is taken any where collectively;</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is, is plain enough from more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then one. The term Angel, I take it, is ſcarce found but to ſignifie an Angel by <hi>nature,</hi> or by <hi>office.</hi> Now it is abſurd to ſay, that all the people in a Church are <hi>ſent,</hi> and <hi>in office:</hi> which is the appellative ſignification of the term.</p>
               <p>To his ſecond anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit <hi>ſpake to the Churches.</hi> Although the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were not directed immediately to all the members, doubtleſſe they were directed to their Officers for their uſe. And thus the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks to us in ſpeaking to the Jews of old: and to the Jews, and Chriſtians in the new Teſtament. Elſe neither the Scriptures of the Old, nor the New Teſtament belong to us.</p>
               <p>He frames a ſecond Objection, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Ob. <q>The Scriptures are committed to the truſt and care of Preachers in Office.</q> 1 Tim. 1.11. 6 20. 2 Tim. 2.14.3.14. Tit. 1.3.</p>
               <p>The bringing of this objection makes me think, he underſtood by <hi>[as well)</hi> that the Scriptures did equally belong to <hi>people</hi> as <hi>Preachers,</hi> and are alike committed to them. For if this objection oppoſeth the doctrine, he muſt mean by belonging, a belonging to them as the Lords <hi>Truſtees</hi> and <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> in the Goſpel. And then his poſition is falſe, and theſe Scriptures which he here quotes unanſwerably prove it ſo. Yet he pretends to anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> As to that text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. it is a very diſputable text, who the Apoſtle calls there, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> is not ſo well agreed, as you preſume. Some refer it to <hi>Timothy.</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

To bar either of theſe interpretations, you have nothing but the poor credit of a comma or two;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118462:32"/> and thoſe that knew any thing, know that the <hi>Originall</hi> copies generally are both without ſtops and diſtinction of verſes. For my own part, I ſhould underſtand it of the living God, and ſupply <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But admit it be the Church, it is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and not proved, that by Church he mean all the individuall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> generally contend, that the Church is there called <hi>the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and thence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Eſtius,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall,</hi> and not of every individuall member of that. And then it is to be conſidered in what ſence <hi>the Church is the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and it is concluded, that the Church is the <hi>pillar of truth,</hi> becauſe in that truth is to be found. As <hi>Proclamations</hi> hang upon pillars, ſo the Church is the Pillar of truth; but (Sir) you prove nothing, if you doe not prove that the Individuall members of the Church are <hi>ſpeaking pillars,</hi> which will be an hard task for you. Indeed they ſhould be pillars of truth, to beare the Law of the Lord upon their hearts and converſations. And they are, as you ſay, from <hi>Iude</hi> 3. to <hi>contend for the faith.</hi> But the queſtion is, whether God hath committed the doctrine of faith to them to preach? No ſuch thing is proved from that text in <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor that in <hi>Iude</hi> neither. And in earneſt (Sir) if every gifted brother be to be a <hi>pillar of truth,</hi> truth hath loſt its uniformity. Many of them have been pillars upon which the divell hath hung all the errors and blaſphemies of former times; not one of many a pillar of truth.</p>

               <p>But Sir, before you had proved your doctrine, you ſhould again have opened it, for the meaning is not clear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether you mean that it is neceſſary they ſhould have the Scriptures opened. Or</p>

               <p>But I am afraid you mean ſomething elſe: that it is <hi>of neceſſity to the people, that they themſelves be able to expound Scriptures.</hi> This you muſt mean, or you have ſpoke little to your purpoſe; and then I deny it: for every Chriſtian (according to your own principles) hath not the guift: and God hath denied no neceſſary guift to any of his Saints.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>YOur next, and in order your fourth poſition is this, <q>That the people as well as the preachers are to abound in the knowledge of the Scriptures. <hi>This you prove, 1.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commanded, <hi>Col. 3.16. 2</hi> It is commended, <hi>Ro. 15.14. 3</hi> It was prophecyed and promiſed it ſhould be ſo.</q>

               <p>This doctrine ſhould have been expounded a little too before it had been proved: that term <hi>[as well as]</hi> upon which the whole ſtrength of your deſigne lies, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any one Scripture, nor can I well tell what you mean by it.

               <p>But if you mean, that it lies upon the people in point of duty, to be as much buſied and verſed in the Scriptures, as the Preacher is bound to be, I cannot yield you that: For that God hath no where ſaid to them as to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Concerning this text, I have already noted to you in my <hi>

That according to this place there need no <hi>election</hi> or <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> or any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>For the reſtraining of it to the daies of Pentecoſt, the Apoſtle hath warranted it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.16. <hi>This is that which was ſpoken, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, it is againſt the coherence of the words, you ſhall doe well to ſhew it us, and then we ſhall reply to it.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, the words doe <hi>import ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> I cannot finde it out in reſpect of <hi>time,</hi> there is no term but <hi>afterwards;</hi> what you can make of that I cannot tell.

I thinke there is not one word the ſame in the text, nor any like. Indeed the two places in the margent are ſomething neerer, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43 3. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Both thoſe ſpeak of a powring out of the Spirit, but neither of them ſpeake of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, nor of ſons and daughters prophecying.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That is, And now in the following verſe he foretels that excellent guift which was given to the Diſciples in the daies of Pentecoſt. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe ſaies that that was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> whence (ſaith he) let no

But he doth not promiſe to all, that they ſhal underſtand all knowledge, and the ſence of Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place let us heare what learned <hi>Mercer</hi> ſaith. <hi>Nunc prophetia de Spiritu Sancto quam die Pentecoſtes fide dignus teſtis Petrus impletam dicit miſſo Spiritu Sancto,</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>This prophecy, ſaith he, is concerning the Holy Ghoſt and <hi>Peter,</hi> who may be believed, applies it to the day of Pentecoſt, when the Holy Ghoſt was ſent, the Apoſtles by his great power gave teſtimony of the reſurrection of Chriſt, who before durſt not teach it, nor come out in publique.

               <p>Firſt (ſaith he) he prophecieth of the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt. — Then (ſaith he) he ſpeaketh of the effects of this Spirit, — to wit, prophecy; under which it is plain from St. <hi>Peters</hi> interpretation, that the guift of Tongues is comprehended. They are properly ſaid to prophecy, who diſcourſe concerning the ſecret will of God, and things to come. <hi>Paul</hi> doth extend the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word further, and ſaies, that they prophecy that expound Scriptures, or attend diligently to others expoſitions.

And they foretold things to come, as what ſhould be the manners of the laſt times; and how the tyranny of Antichriſt ſhould waſte the Church in a dreadfull manner—.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Wherein is examined Mr. <hi>Sheppards 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</hi> pages, and his fifth propoſition, ſcann'd and examined.</head>
               <p>YOur fifth propoſition is this: <q>That the guift of Scripture expoſition and explication being a part of the prophecy which doth now remain in the Church, is a guift common to all the people of Chriſt out of Office, as well as the preachers of Chriſt in Office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This now well proved were worth ſomething to your purpoſe. Here are two things to be proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the guift of Scripture expoſition and explanation is a part of the prophecie which doth now remain in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is a common guift.</hi> I am miſtaken if I finde ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe well proved. You ſhould have proved the former firſt, but you begin with the latter; and I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your method. Now to prove that this is a common guift, you would prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all Gods people have Gods Spirit,</hi> Jam. 4.5. 1 Theſ. 4.8. 1 John 4.13. Rom. 8.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Spirit is a Spirit of illumination, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture interpretation,</hi> Zech. 12.10. Rom. 8.15, 26. Eph. 6.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That by this they are or may be enabled to ſee the ſenſe and meaning of Scripture,</hi> 1 Cor. 2 12. Eph. 1.17, 18. Jer. 31.33. Pſal. 40.7, 8. Jo. 3.27. Jo. 10.26. Jo 6.44, 45. Matth. 13.11, 12, 16.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of your ninth and tenth pages.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I grant it, <hi>that all Gods people have the Spirit.</hi> But (Sir) ſurely you were not guided by this Spirit in the interpreting of Scripture, when to prove this you quote <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. The words are theſe. Doe you think that the Scripture ſpeaketh in vain, <hi>The ſpirit that dwelleth in us
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118462:38"/> luſteth to envy.</hi> Is that meant of the holy Spirit of God, think you? But the thing is truth: that all Gods people have the Spirit now let us make it into an argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſo hath the Spirit of God hath the guift of expounding Scripture.—But all Gods people have the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>they all have the guift of expounding Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nego majorem.</hi> Prove (Sir) your firſt propoſition: and to this purpoſe I ſuppoſe you bring your next <hi>medium,</hi> and tell us that this Spirit is a ſpirit of <hi>illumination and Scripture interpretation, in all that have it.</hi> Your Logick is this.</p>
               <q>If the Spirit of God in all that have it be a Spirit of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture interpretation, then whoſo hath the Spirit hath that guift. But the Spirit in all that have it is a Spirit of Scripture interpretation. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nego minorem.</hi> The latter propoſition is falſe. I grant you that the Spirit is a Spirit of interpretation, that is, that the <hi>Spirit can teach a man the meaning of Scripture;</hi> for all Scripture is dictated by the Spirit, and <hi>ejuſdem eſt interpretari ac condere.</hi> Yet let me tell you, you are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to me for granting you this, for you have not proved it. You indeed bring in (againſt their wils) the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> proving it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. where are theſe words, <hi>I will poure upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem the ſpirit of grace, and of ſupplications, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is no mention of the Spirit of Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Your other place is <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.15, 26. v. 15. <hi>For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have rceeived the ſpirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father:</hi> v. 16. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit maketh interceſſion for us, &amp;c.</hi> Here is plain men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the ſpirit of bondage and adoption, and ſupplication, and interceſſion. But you are a better Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician then I, if you can from any of theſe Texts prove that the Spirit is a Spirit of Scripture interpretation;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118462:39"/> though the thing be a truth, (Sir) yet, I ſay, you are beholding to me to yield it you in arguing.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will grant you a little further, <hi>that the Spirit of God in whomſoever it dwels doth ſo farre enlighten their minds in the knowledge of the Scriptures, that they may ſee all that is neceſſary for them to know in reference to their own ſalvation.</hi> But this the Spirit doth upon their reading and hearing, imprinting a perſwaſion of the truth of what they heare and read upon their hearts.</p>
               <p>But though I yield you eaſily that the Spirit is a Spirit of <hi>Scripture interpretation; yet I deny that it is in all, ſo.</hi> Nay, I ſhall queſtion whether it be in any ſo as you would have it.</p>
               <p>I grant you in theſe: 1. <hi>That the Spirit doth dwell in all.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Spirit can interpret Scriptures.</hi> 3. <hi>That it doth doe as I have ſaid.</hi> But I conceive that which you would have is this, <hi>That the Spirit by a ſecret immediate work doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten men (without the uſe of ordinary means) ſuch as are the underſtanding the tongues, weighing conſequences, conſidering coherences, &amp;c,) in the underſtanding of the Scriptures. That a Saint</hi> quà a Saint, <hi>by vertue of the Spirit dwelling in him, is able to interpret any Scriptures, ſo as to expound them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> This is a falſe and dangerous opinion; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpend a few words to ſhew you what aſſiſtance the Spirit of God ordinarily gives men in the opening of Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Spirit of God hath by ſuch an immediate worke ſhewn its power in enlightning the minds of his Saints hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is true, ſo he did in the Apoſtles daies.</hi> But thus the Spirit doth not now.</p>

There might be a quick experience of this: Take a Saint and turn him to a difficult place of Scripture or two, and try if he can give an infallible interpretation; which he muſt doe if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the immediate work of the Spirit that dwelleth in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. If this were a truth, <hi>The ſame Saint could never alter his judgement upon any one text.</hi> But I believe you will ſee cauſe, Sir, to alter yours (as many Saints before you have done theirs) in the application of ſome Scriptures which you have made uſe of; and we live in times when moſt eminent Saints give this to be the ſenſe of a Scripture now, and another a twelve moneth hence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor doe I ſee <hi>how you can ſhift granting, that every Saint muſt have this faculty;</hi> for in every Saint the Spirit dwels.

Nor doth that Text you bring, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 20.27. prove it. The knowledge of all things there ſpoken of, muſt not be taken in the latitude, for ſo we know the Scripture would not be true. The meaning is, all the parts of <hi>doctrine neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation,</hi> ſaith <hi>Deodate;</hi> but the interpretation of all the Scriptures, or an ability to doe it is not neceſſary to ſalvation.

               <p>This propoſition now is ſo mollified, that I know not how to touch it. Firſt, it is minced with <hi>are or may be;</hi> who can deny that ſo long as there is an Almighty God. Then it is minced with <hi>more or leſse;</hi> it were hard elſe, if there ſhould be any Saint, that ſhould not be able to tell the meaning of one line in Scripture. Then I meet with the term <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which I know not whether I ſhould underſtand it of the Scriptures generally, or ſo much of Scripture <hi>as is neceſſary for them to know in order to ſalvation:</hi> If in the latter ſenſe, it is true enough; if in the former ſenſe, the Author will underſtand it, ſtill he will ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the arms of his <hi>are,</hi> or may be: or elſe of his <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſſe.</hi> But to prove this he brings 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. onely he feares it will be objected againſt. How he hath warded it we will conſider by and by; onely by the way I could

               <p>I am glad to heare you of that mind; that God hath grounded you in his truth againſt Enthuſiaſmes. But ſir, I muſt tell you, they may be known to us by the hearing of the word of God opened to us, and preached to us, and uſually are ſo. And therefore it will not follow, that a Chriſtian in order to his knowledge of them muſt have in himſelfe the ſpirit of interpretation. You further tell us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"That the promiſes are the things freely given us of God; (ſome of them at leaſt.)</hi> 2 Pet. 1.20.</p>
               <p>Truth, Sir; and the Spirit muſt make us to know that theſe promiſes belong to us: but doth it therefore follow that every Chriſtian muſt have an ability to open all the Scriptures? Many of the promiſes, thoſe eſpecially of greateſt concernment, are ſo plainly written, that he that runs may read and underſtand them. Some of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes indeed are darker. Nor doe I think every Chriſtian hath an ability to underſtand all the promiſes fully; but God is pleaſed to enable his Saints to underſtand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſo many of them, and ſo far as they are neceſſarily to be underſtood in <hi>order to his ſalvation.</hi> But we (Sir) that are as much verſed, I believe, and ſomething more, then thoſe not in the Miniſtry, with the workings of Chriſtians ſpirits, finde it by experience, that Gods deareſt Saints oft times put ſtrange interpretations upon the promiſes: which is evidence enough, that the Spirit doth not enable all Saints to know the true meaning of them. But I return again to the 11. and 12. pages.</p>
               <p>Having laid down for a poſition, that all the Saints have a ſeminall vertue enabling them to expound Scriptures,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118462:42"/> you come to enquire the cauſe why it doth not appeare; and you are pleaſed to charge it upon us, ſaying,

               <q>Let the Preachers tell the people there is ſuch a ſeed in them, and preſſe upon them the neceſſity of improving it.</q>
               <p>To all this impertinent diſcourſe I ſhall anſwer briefly. That the Preachers are charged falſely: we doe deſire all that fear God to <hi>ſtir up the guift that is in them,</hi> to be much in <hi>reading and ſtudying of the Scriptures,</hi> to meditate upon them, to inſtruct their families out of them.

But (Sir) we muſt finde God commanding us to doe it, before we durſt take your counſell. But yet your experiment hath been tried, and is (God knows) too much. There is a liberty enough given to men this way, and the people are ready enough to take it. Nor are there ſome wanting that have bidden them God ſpeed.

               <p>Your ſecond reaſon to prove that they may uſe the guift is, <hi>becauſe they have the ſame guift the Preachers have.</hi> The Argument is thus:

               <p>But thirdly, you tell us that <hi>reaſonably they ſhould uſe the guift, becauſe they have occaſion to uſe it, to reprove, exhort, teach, comfort.</hi> This you told us before <hi>p.</hi> 9. I told you then this proves a private uſe, but not a publique uſe of their guifts.</p>
               <p>But you tell us fourthly, <hi>that God hath commanded them to uſe this guift,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.11. I have fully anſwered this place, I mean this falſe gloſſe put upon it, in my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> p. 57. to which I refer you.</p>

               <p>What you mean by <hi>expounding Scripture</hi> I cannot tell. If you mean by it ſearching the Scripture, to finde out the will of God in it, for the advantage of their own ſoules, and to furniſh them to the duties of their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and callings, it is granted you. But if you mean by expounding, undertaking to deliver to Congregations, this to be the meaning of the Scripture, you have neither proved it is commanded nor commended.</p>
               <p>Your five reaſons which have ſerved almoſt all your Doctrines prove it not. To the firſt I anſwer: What ever duty lies upon private Chriſtians to doe, may be done by them to their brethren, without ſpeaking to them out of <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond I anſwer: You have not proved that they have the guift of Scripture expoſition; if they have the guift, yet they muſt have the Office too. Thoſe two places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. I anſwered before.</p>
               <p>To the third, <hi>I deny that they muſt be able to expound them themſelves, to enable them to make the beſt advantage of them.</hi> The beſt uſe they can make of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To your fourth, I ſay, that this was never commended by God. Indeed ſearching the Scriptures, to ſee if it be true that Preachers ſay, is in that place <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118462:46"/> but for that other place which you quote, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. I admire at your application of it. The words are theſe, <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, to which ye ſhall doe well if ye take heed,</hi>

               <p>Your third place to prove it is commended, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that he was perſwaded they <hi>were full of goodneſſe, full of all knowledge, able to admoniſh
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118462:46"/> one another.</hi> Here he commends them, that they were full of all knowledge; but how doth he commend them here for expounding Scripture, that is a piece of practice. Nor doth the Apoſtle mean,<note place="margin">Scilicet eorum quae ad fidem pietatem &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem ſicat piis neceſſaria. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus ad loc.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, you tell us, <hi>they are commanded to expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> but where, ſir? You tell us, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. For that place, <hi>Io.</hi> 5.39. they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed commanded to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> but what is that to a practicall expounding of them?</p>
               <p>In <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. we are commanded to teach our children the Law of God, and to talk of it in our houſe: but doe you think (ſir) every Jewiſh houſholder was to expound the Law, or that there have not been many old Chriſtians have taught their children and families more of the Law of God heretofore, then profeſſors uſually doe now, and yet never expounded the Law to them. But ſuppoſe they may hint to their families ſome obvious obſervations from the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>es they read (though I doe not think that is commanded there) yet neither is this an expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Scriptures, nor that which you plead for.</p>
               <p>For the third place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. I ſpake to it before: There is nothing but a generall command to Chriſtians, to uſe the guift of God beſtowed on them; which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall muſt be reſtrained by other Scriptures, to manner, time, and place. Your laſt proofe is 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>There indeed Chriſtians are commanded to <hi>let the word of God dwell in them richly, to teach, and admoniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But (ſir) all this may be done without expounding Scripture: ſo that this place proves nothing to your purpoſe. And thus I have ſhewed you the inſufficiency of the proofe of this propoſition, though if you mean no more, <hi>Then that it is the duty of Chriſtians privately to read, ſearch, and ſtudy the Scriptures, to endeavour to finde out Gods

                     </gap>ure by expoſition is made more uſefull and profitable.</hi> This doth not prove (ſir) that therefore they ought to expound it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or one to another. This proves indeed that it ought to be expounded to them.</p>

Your ſecond reaſon, <hi>becauſe they are to be alwaies tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, reproving, &amp; comforting one another: and this cannot be done without expounding, &amp;c.</hi> How often ſhall I anſwer this crambe? 1. This may be done by <hi>applying to themſelves and others plaine and eaſie Scriptures,</hi> for which there needs no expounding. 2. <hi>By applying to themſelves and others the ſound interpretation of thoſe that God hath call'd to that office</hi> to interpret his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>Every private Chriſtian hath in him a guift more or leſſe,</hi> and <hi>this is not to be hid.</hi> To prove that they have a guift of Scripture interpretation you
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118462:47"/> bring again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 17. I am ſick of this tautologizing, this is the third time I have met with this, but I muſt look I ſee inſtead of ſtrength of arguments, for to be ſerved with a flood of words, I anſwer again you have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they have all a guift. 2.

               <p>I Am come to the laſt of your Lifeguard, your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That opening and applying Scriptures by private men one to another, in a way of teaching, reproofe, Admonition, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and comfort hath beene frequently bleſſed of God for the begetting of grace in the hearers, and increaſe of it.</q>

                     </gap>ffice. <hi>To all I anſwer:</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. (Sir) if you meane that God hath pleaſed to bleſſe the private labours of his people in their private exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and reprovings of one another to encreaſe Grace in the ſoules of his ſervants, I doubt it not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if you meane that God hath frequently bleſſed the <hi>publike preachments of perſons not called to that office</hi> for the converſion of ſoules, I doubt it very much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You make a very ill appeale to the <hi>Converts of our age.</hi> Perverts there are many, but the Lord knowes few converts, and very ſtrange believers and profeſſors; appeale (Sir) to the old puritanes of formes ages, aske them by whom God ſpake to their hearts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods making uſe of ſuch meanes, as private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or reproofes to convert ſouls, doth not prove that this is Gods great ordinance, for that end <hi>Waldus</hi> the father of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> confeſſeth his converſion to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death of a friend or companion of his, but yet none will ſay ſudden deaths are Gods ordinance for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God may ſometimes poſſibly begin a conviction by a private reproof, but I believe he uſually makes uſe of his word Preached to beget Faith, and to perfect the work.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſay the <hi>holy one is not limited,</hi> but I believe you would be poſed to bring me one good inſtance of a ſoule converted from a looſe and profane life to an humble, cloſe, ſtrict walking with God in truth and uprightneſſe that hath ſate under no meanes but onely the Preaching of a private perſon, that not being called to the office of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118462:50"/> the Miniſtry hath yet ſet upon that work, it were eaſie to bring you five hundred that have been perverted.</p>
               <p>I appeale to all the Hereticks and Blaſphemers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all the Antinomians, Antiſcripturiſts, Antitrinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ranters, where did any of you learn your principles? was it with conſtant hearing of the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or rather was it not with hearing men that without any call but upon the pretence of their gifts undertooke to expound the myſteries of God.</p>
               <p>And (Sir) if three have been this way converted and edified, and the ſoules of five hundred perverted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, what becomes of your propoſition, or to what purpoſe is it brought us?</p>
               <p>To your proofes, <hi>That God doth hold forth thoſe duties and ordinances as meanes of Grace,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.16. Math. 18.15, 16, 17. Jam. 5.19, 20. we grant it, and they are ſo when performed regularly; the woman may be an inſtrument to ſave her husband. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16. <hi>But not by Preaching to him,</hi> but by carrying her ſelfe as a believing wife before him, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. proves it concerning private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but prove Sir, by any Scripture. <hi>That the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Brother,</hi> not <hi>called to the office</hi> hath a promiſe made to him.</p>
               <p>"You tell us ſecondly, that it is <hi>the word that doth rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and this (very controverſiall truth doubleſſe) you prove by a whole line of quotations. Fewer would have ſerved the turne (you ſhould lay moſt proofe Sir up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the weakeſt cauſe) <hi>He that diſpenſeth it, is but the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or conduit-pipe by which it is carried,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5. Very much truth doubtleſſe; but to what purpoſe doth any ſpeak otherwiſe? hence you infer, that <hi>the word is the ſame in a private, as in a publike officers mouth;</hi> True Sir, it is ſo <hi>materially,</hi> but not <hi>formally;</hi> the one ſpeaks with <hi>authority,</hi> the former only as a <hi>Scribe,</hi> the one as Chriſts <hi>meſſenger</hi> particularly entruſted, the other without any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:118462:50"/>
               <p>By this time your conſcience checks you, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.14, 15, 16. and you in this doctrine are not of a minde and p. 19, 20, 21. you ſpend, to anſwer that unanſwerable place.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>1.</hi> You grant that the Preaching of the word by a Preacher in office is the ſpeciall and common way of gathering in men to Chriſt, and a ſingular ordinance for increaſe of men gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and converted, yet this is not the onely meanes, nor all the Ordinances of Grace, for there are many more that men are to attend upon for their edification and growth in Grace as well as this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(Sir) for this conceſſion we thanke you, for we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to any one that in this erroneous age will give an aſſent to any truth of God, and to requite you, we grant you that Preaching of officers is not the only means of edification, which is all you ſay.</p>
               <p>But you conceive that that place, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10, 13, 14, 15. is miſtaken, and therefore you have favoured us with a kinde of looſe paraphraſe, p. 19, 20. But Sir to keep you cloſe to the buſineſſe, <hi>what ſending is there meant?</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainely ſayes, how ſhall <hi>they preach except they be ſent?</hi> your paraphraſe hath not touched this paſſage; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you were ſhy of it wittingly, for this is the onely paſſage in the Text that galleth you.</p>
               <p>You tell us negatively, p. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"That it is not to be taken in a literall and reſtrained ſence, for then theſe things would follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>
                     <hi>1.</hi> That by hearing the Scriptures read by a Preacher in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, men may (I ſuppoſe you would <hi>ſay, may not</hi>) be brought to believe.</q> But you think men may be converted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or hearing them read by any.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>2.</hi> That men are not brought into or nouriſhed in the faith of the Goſpell by reading Scriptures, Epiſtles, good bookes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>
                     <hi>3.</hi> That it is as impoſſible for a man to have Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing a called Preacher, as to be ſaved without Faith,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118462:51"/> or to have Faith without the word of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſier to ſay what is not meant then what is, but p. 21. you tell us. <hi>That the Text is cleare enough that by Preachers ſent is meant any one that God by his providence ſhall ſend to tell men the glad newes of the Goſpell; by the ſubſequent words,</hi> v. 15. <hi>and the two Texts, Nahum.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 52.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pag. 20. <q>
                     <hi>You tell us, that</hi> when a gifted brother doth preach the doctrine of the Apoſtles and prophets, the hearers heare the Apoſtles and prophets, who were preachers ſent.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>
                     <hi>3.</hi> If the Scripture it ſelf without any preacher ſpeak, then it may be heard without any other preacher, then he that firſt preacht it. If the workes of God have a voyce and ſpeake, as they have, and doe preach, Pſal. <hi>19.1, 2, 3.</hi> Micah <hi>6 9.</hi> If the works of men ſpeake as Heb. <hi>11.4. Abel</hi> being dead yet ſpeaketh, that is teacheth the world to imitate him, how much more then may Gods word be ſaid to ſpeake.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <q>
                     <hi>4.</hi> That the Apoſtles did preach by their writings as well as by their voyce and ſpeech.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of all you ſay over and over again; it comes to this little pittance of truth, that preaching is taken in a proper and in a figurative ſenſe, that a man may be ſent providentially as well as authoritatively; but Sir:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We will allow that gifted brethren may Preach, as the workes of God are ſaid to preach, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah.</hi> 6.9. And as dead <hi>Abel</hi> ſpake, but (Sir) theſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gods <hi>heralds,</hi> as thoſe ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods word (Sir) doth <hi>ſpeake,</hi> but it doth not <hi>preach</hi> (in Scripture phraſe) nor is its ſpeaking the ordinary meanes of God to convert ſoules to Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> tels you <hi>there is a difference betweene reading and preaching a Sermon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughes</hi> in his Goſpel-worſhip ſaith the latter is under a <hi>more ſpeciall appointment for converſion of ſoules then the other.</hi> God hath ſaid, <hi>Heare and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> Not, <hi>Read and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> though we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118462:51"/> grant reading to be a duty, and of ſingular uſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For your new Nonneno of <hi>ſecond hand hearing,</hi> the Scripture allowes no ſuch diſtinction, that's but a cheat put upon the reader, will not any one thinke him mad that ſhould interpret, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> that is, <hi>by reading,</hi> and how ſhall they preach, that is, <hi>how ſhall the Scriptures preach,</hi> except they be ſent?</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the ſame foppiſh fancy I would avoid all places of Scripture that plead either for <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>hearing. Go preach and baptize,</hi> what is the meaning of that, go preach by an holy life and baptize, or go write bookes and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; but having ſhewed you the folly of your quibles, I come to your anſwer. As you cannot avoid the ſtrength of this place by diſtinguiſhing of preaching, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching there meant, being the preaching of words not of workes, and writings, and dead letters, but the preaching of them that make reports of God to the ſoule, <hi>v.</hi> 16. thoſe that have <hi>feet,</hi> and bring glad tidings of peace, not the Goſpells preaching, but the <hi>preaching of the Goſpell,</hi> v. 16. ſuch a preaching as hath a <hi>ſound</hi> goe with it, <hi>v.</hi> 18. and correlates to hearing.</p>
               <p>So neither can you avoid it by diſtinguiſhing upon <hi>ſending,</hi> I demand <hi>what ſending is meant?</hi> you tell me a <hi>providentiall ſending, and this is cleare enough by theſe ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words,</hi> v. 15. Nahum. 1.15: Eſ. 52.7.</p>
               <p>So ſay the Socinians and Eraſtians, but it is a miſerable ſhift.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Originall word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies to ſend as an embaſſadour (ſaith <hi>A lapide</hi>) to ſend with power and authority (ſaith <hi>Chamier.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly I am at a loſſe to underſtand this blind notion of a <hi>Providentiall ſending,</hi> when may a man be ſaid to be <hi>Providentially ſent?</hi> And indeed it hath poſed better heads then mine to fadome this Notion, how ſhall one know if he be providentially ſent, will you ſay, if God hath furniſhed him with gifts, and he meets with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118462:52"/> an opportunity to exerciſe them? then a Blaſphemer may be <hi>a ſent preacher,</hi> for he is providentially ſent, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God permitting him to play his game, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtle never meant ſuch a ſending as might be from the Devill <hi>directly,</hi> and from God onely <hi>permiſſively;</hi> yet ſuch are providentially ſent; but I have cleared this Text from this <hi>Eraſtian gloſſe</hi> in my <hi>Vindiciae Miniſterii,</hi> p. 42, 43, 44, 45.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, let us ſee what ſenſe you have made of the Apoſtles words by your gloſſe: <hi>how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,</hi> that is, either by the writings of good men; or by reading of the Scriptures, or by conſidering the workes of God, or by making uſe of the Examples of dead Saints (for this four-fold hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you will have) <hi>and how ſhall they heare without a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> that is, how ſhall they read the Scriptures if they have no Scriptures to reade? how ſhall they conſider the workes of God, if they have none to conſider? how ſhall they read good bookes, if none write any? how ſhall they imitate ſuch men as <hi>Abel</hi> if there be none to imitate? <hi>And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent,</hi> that is, how ſhall any man ſpeake to another, if he doth not come where he is? Sir, I am of the minde the ſpirit never guided you in this interpretation, by which you have juſtled out the two great ordinances of the Goſpell, <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and have pleaded faire for the Papiſts who tell us of their pictures preaching, and making lay-men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But fourthly:</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sir doe you thinke the Apoſtles were no more then providentially ſent? had <hi>Iſaias</hi> no more thinke you, nor the 70 any more?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:118462:52"/>5. The providence of God ordereth all our motions and actions, <hi>Hananiah, Ier.</hi> 28. was <hi>providentially</hi> ſent, but was he ſent to work faith in the hearers think you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is ſuch a ſending, as it muſt be a duty in us to heare them that are ſo ſent, but providentiall ſending is no ſuch ſending, the ſeducers mentioned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6, were providentially ſent, (how came they there elſe?) but yet ſurely it was not a Chriſtians duty to heare them, but to avoid them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. So that Sir, what ſending ſoever the Apoſtle meanes, it was not a meere providentiall ſending, you muſt find out a new diſtinction, or you cannot avoid this place.</p>
               <p>But you ſay,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> the Text cannot be underſtood in <hi>a literall and reſtrained ſenſe:</hi> what that is you doe not mention.

               <p>
                  <q>That by reading the Scripture or hearing it read, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be converted.</q> This is the ſubſtance of your firſt and ſecond cavill which are both the ſame, but you have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118462:53"/> not writ your book by the rule of <hi>fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poſſit per pauciora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You anſwer, <hi>that then it will follow, that it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible "for a man to be converted and have faith without hearing a ſent preacher, as it is for a man to be ſaved without faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To theſe three cavills I anſwer, <hi>that it is not ordinary for a man to be converted by reading, or hearing the Scriptures read,</hi> nor by hearing thoſe that are not miniſters of the Goſpell. To God all things are poſſible, nay, I believe an hundred are ſaved without actuall faith, to one that is converted by a gifted brother, or any way but by Goſpel-officers; for what ſhall we thinke of children of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents dying in their infancy. But ſecondly:</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to your owne interpretation no man can be converted but <hi>by a Preacher ſent providentially;</hi> ſo that for your objection concerning <hi>Reading</hi> and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that way,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Gilleſpy Miſcell.</hi> Qu.</note> it will fall heavy upon your ſelfe, and when you unty it for your ſelfe, we ſhall have the liberty to make uſe of your diſtinction for us we hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Preaching is as neceſſary as hearing,</hi> and a ſent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher as neceſſary as either, yet all onely mentioned as Gods ordinary meanes to which he is not tied.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are all neceſſary, not by abſolute neceſſity, God can ſave thoſe that never call'd upon him, nor actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believed nor heard, but he doth not ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or ſave thoſe that have opportunities to heare prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gilleſpy Miſcel.</hi> Queſt. p. 41.</note> and time of believing, and refuſe thoſe meanes of grace which he hath appointed: <hi>It will be hard to prove ſaith Mr.</hi> Gilleſpy <hi>that any believe who can heare the Goſpell preacht by Miniſters lawfully call'd and ſent, and doe not heare it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, it is poſſible that by reading the Scripture, or hearing it read, or by conferences, or private exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or reproofes, or the like, God may create in ſome ſoules, reflections upon themſelves, and begin convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118462:53"/> but the queſtion is now, ſuppoſe theſe Chriſtians ſhould never hear a miniſter of the Goſpel preach, and yet might doe it, whether a continued Reading were enough to carry on this work to a full worke of conviction and contrition, and to a clozing with Chriſt in ſincerity. I doubt whether one inſtance of this can be brought or no. (Sir) every ſlighty conviction and reflection of ones Spirit upon it ſelf, that may be in order to converſion is not formall converſion.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, having examined your lifeguard, I come to the great propoſition which you lay downe p. 21.</p>

               <p>THis great point of controverſie as you call it, you lay downe p. 21. open it p. 22. I will be thrifty of my paper, and take you at the ſecond rebound; in the cloſe of the 22 page you tell us, The ſumme of what you hold is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That a man out of office, gifted indeed and fitted to the worke, may lawfully in a publike way expound and apply the Scriptures to the people in a ſettled Church, without any externall call of the Church enabling and authorizing him to the office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is without <hi>Election, Ordination, or confirmation,</hi> (as you expound it before) this propoſition you, 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. 2. Limit. 3. Pretend to prove. 4. And to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from objections. In this Chapter I will examine your Extenſions and Limitations. For your Extenſions, you ſay it may be done,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. <hi>In ſome caſes ordinarily and conſtantly,</hi> what caſes

               <p>We grant you all this <hi>where there are no preachers in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice can be heard;</hi> it may be done as you ſay ordinarily and conſtantly, and he that doth it may expect a more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aſſiſtance of God, in regard the ordinary means faile. But (Sir) what kind of conſtituted Churches are theſe that have no preachers in office belonging to them. I take it, a conſtituted Church muſt be a body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians united, and under the inſpection of a Paſtour.</p>
               <p>Extraordinarily and occaſionally, if on the Lords day the congregation be met, and the Miniſter failes through ſickneſſe or otherwiſe, and there be no preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter near to whom the people may go, we agree with you, that a private perſon, if prepared and truly gifted, may either in the Church, or in ſome other place, according to his gift, diſcourſe of the Scripture to the people, though we think he might ſpend the time as well in repeating a Sermon to them, and they ſpend their time as well in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home and ſearching the Scriptures, and meditating and praying privately.</p>
               <p>It is true that you ſay, that there were exhortations in the Jewiſh Synagogues, but the places you quote, <hi>Io.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.28, 13, 15, 20, 9. prove onely that Jeſus Chriſt ſo taught, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> (called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. a Miniſter, and rank'd with <hi>Paul</hi>) ſo exhorted, none of theſe were meere gifted brethren.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>And that in caſe of planting or decay, or corruption of a Church, and where a Church is not regularly conſtituted, that in theſe and ſuch like caſes a gifted man may ordinarily and publikely preacht and that without a ſolemn call.</q> And</p>

               <p>Here is now an huddle of arguments together, all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of our own conceſſions and practice; for my better anſwer I will obſerve this method.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>
                  <hi>What private perſons may doe in their families privately, that they may doe in a conſtituted Church, and its aſſembly publikely, but privately they may teach their Children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>I deny your major utterly, (Sir) you may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that every private perſon may rule the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may rule in his family. God hath ſet him over his family to inſtruct that, but not over his Church to inſtruct that; ſee my anſwer to this trifling argument in my Vindiciae, p. 64. 65.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>But you ſay people and preachers are both meant alike <hi>Rev. 1. v. 5, 6.19. 1 Pet. 2.9.</hi>—and therefore the duty and power laid upon them and given them hereby, is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in other places as well as their own houſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I grant you, that for the terme <hi>Prieſts,</hi> it doth not properly belong to the Miniſters of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is <hi>by alluſion applyed to both, and the people are called Prieſts, and Preachers Prieſts</hi> in a common notion. But yet let me tell you, I doe not thinke their ſervices are both alike. For:</p>

               <p>I wonder how many words you would have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine a Text, here are four or five, 1. <hi>To thy children.</hi> 2. <hi>In thy houſe.</hi> 3. <hi>When thou lyeſt downe and riſeſt up.</hi> 4. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sir, we can give you no licenſe to preach to any. To the law and to the teſtimony, if that ſay you may, you may, if not, you may not; this Text in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> gives you no liberty to preach to them, nor doe I know any that doe; you may doubtleſſe, if they come occaſionally

               <p n="1">1. If the preachers have deviſed the diſtinctions of <hi>Occaſionally</hi> and <hi>Extraordinarily, and privately,</hi> you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to them for it, for you your ſelf make uſe of them, p. 23. and tell us, that but in ſome caſes it may be done <hi>ordinarily and conſtantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the very word <hi>privately</hi> ſhould not be found in Scripture, yet words are found that argue the ſame thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. exhort <hi>one another,</hi> which is a terme of a private notion and differing from exhorting the congregation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The peoples inquiry concerning the <hi>interpretation of Scripture</hi> was privately, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.36. contrary to the practice of many publikely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Preachers when they have done their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or interrupting them when they are preaching.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As the term (extraordinarily) is not put in, ſo neither is it needfull: for the duties commanded them are, to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118462:57"/> be done ordinarily, viz to admoniſh, reprove, comfort, ſupport, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though it be no where ſaid they muſt doe it onely <hi>privately,</hi> yet withall it is no where ſaid they may do it in a conſtituted Church that hath publike officers to preach to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Neither is there any one example of any not gifted with the extraordinary gifts of the holy Choſt, nor in office that did it publikely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. If <hi>Apollos</hi> mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.25, 26. were at that time out of office (which yet by your favour is not doubtleſſe) yet he was no private perſon, for it is more then probable, he had the extraordinary gift of proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="8">8. The very putting in of that terme, Acts 18.28. <hi>and that publikely</hi> argued that it was not ordinary for private perſons or any not in office to <hi>ſpeake publikely</hi> in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is an eaſie thing for men to pretend ignorance, when they have no mind to underſtand; to helpe you, <hi>By privately,</hi> we meane not in publike aſſemblies and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: By <hi>extraordinarily</hi> we meane they may doe it. 1. Where no Miniſters in office can be procured or reſorted to, till ſuch time as the congregation can be ſupplyed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The duties <hi>enjoyned are common and neceſsary,</hi> but thoſe duties are private exhortings, not <hi>publike expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> for thoſe are neither common nor neceſſary to be performed by perſons not in office, and the command is generall, but not to all duties.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The command to preach is no more common then that to Baptize <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. But your ſelfe will grant they may not Baptize, unty the knot for your ſelf, and you doe it for us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. What though the ſame words be uſed to expreſſe

The Magiſtrate in his charge at an aſſize may be ſaid to <hi>exhort:</hi> yet ſurely it is not every private perſons duty ſo to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If the uſe of the ſame word for both be any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then they are not only bound to exhort and preach but to doe it as Apoſtles and prophets and paſtors, the places you quote will prove this, yet you your ſelfe ſay, p. 24. that they cannot doe it as preachers in office, in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="14">14. The ſame word ſignifies to Baptize and to waſh our hands, or pots and cups, and by your Logick it will follow, that every man that may waſh his hands, or every kitchin wench, that is by her office to waſh a cup, may Baptize a Chriſtian, why? the word is the ſame.</p>
               <p>But to proceed yet with you p. 30. you ſay:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We grant that in caſe of planting, or decay, or corruption of a Church, and where a church is not regularly conſtituted, that in theſe and ſuch like caſes, a gifted man may ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publikely preach without a ſolemne call.

               <p>But you <hi>tell us this is our caſe or very neere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are beholden to you for this (Sir) are we no better then Heathens thinke you? 2. Have we no officers ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>England?</hi> nor 3. Any meanes of Ordination? But our <hi>Churches are not rightly conſtituted.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (Sir) is rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, here are in it preachers rightly ordained, and people rightly qualified, and the ordinances rightly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>particular Churches in England, poſſibly they may not be organized regularly,</hi> but conſtituted they are, though corrupted, and ſo have much need to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

               <p>But fourthly you tell us we grant you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That gifted men may preach as Probationers, and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what manner and method they pleaſe, without any call at all—and that a judge may give a charge,—and a Colo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nell

               <p n="2">2. We alſo grant, that men may exerciſe their gifts as <hi>probationers,</hi> but not in what <hi>manner and method they pleaſe;</hi> for their method we deny them not what they pleaſe, but for the manner it muſt not be ordinarily but once or twice, or more, in order to <hi>Timothies</hi> laying on of hands upon them, which muſt not be ſuddenly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Probationers muſt not be <hi>Naylors, Taylors, Coblers, &amp;c.</hi> but ſuch as have <hi>beene approved,</hi> as have <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Scriptures</hi> and give themſelves wholly to that worke.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But what followes upon this grant?</p>
               <p>Will you conclude that therefore thoſe that never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the office of the Miniſtry, nor to give themſelves wholly to that worke, may make it a Trade to preach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Lords day in a conſtituted Church, is there no odds thinke you (Sir) betwixt our grant and your taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion? we have given you an <hi>inch,</hi> you have taken an <hi>ell.</hi>

               <p>But laſtly you tell us, <hi>that we doe conſtantly admit prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to preach for us that are ſtrangers to us, and of whoſe call we can have no aſſurance,</hi> I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no argument to argue a <hi>facto ad jus,</hi> that becauſe ſome doe it, it is lawfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſurely none do it, if they know them to be ſuch as are not called, if we be deceived by report or common fame, or their own words, the ſin is not ours ſo much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I know none that doe it; if there be any, let them plead for themſelves. If ſuch thruſt into our places, we give them no leave.</p>

               <p>I Am come now to the ſecond argument (which you call <hi>a maine one.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>That it is no where forbidden in the word of God, and then it cannot be unlawfull.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your Logick is this.</p>
               <p>What is <hi>not forbidden to be done is not unlawfull:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the ordinary preaching of gifted uncalled men in a conſtituted Church is not forbidden,</hi> Ergo. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label>
               </p>
               <p>As you deliver your mind we muſt be forced firſt to diſtinguiſh, then to anſwer: 1. A thing is forbidden ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>generally</hi> or <hi>ſpecially,</hi> either <hi>directly</hi> or by <hi>conſequence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you meane that what is no way forbidden in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither by any generall precept, nor by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar precept, neither directly, nor by conſequence, is not unlawfull, then we grant you that what <hi>is not forbidden in that ſenſe is not unlawfull.</hi> But every thing not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or allowed is in that ſenſe forbidden, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. It is forbidden to <hi>adde any thing to the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then we deny your <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſay, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preaching of perſons uncalled publikely in conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Churches or publike aſſemblies, if they be ſuch as have not the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt (which are now ceaſed) is forbidden.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For how <hi>ſhall they preach except they be ſent,</hi> Ro. 10.15. and no man takes this honour to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no where <hi>commanded nor allowed,</hi> therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly forbidden.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:118462:60"/>3. <hi>Conſequentially they are forbidden,</hi> for it is an act of office which they are (by your own confeſſion) forbidden <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18, 19.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If you meane by <hi>not forbidden, not forbidden</hi> in ſo many words, we deny your Major, and ſay it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a thing is lawfull, becauſe it is not forbidden in ſo many words. For upon this ſcore the Surples, the Croſſe in Baptiſme, bowing at the name of Jeſus: in ſhort, moſt of the Popiſh ceremonies are not thus forbidden.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But you ſay, this duty is alike neceſſary with prayer, and you know not any reaſon why the ſame rules and liberties ſhould not be granted in one as the other, that it be done in all places, and at all times and all manner of wayes, <hi>1 Tim. 2.8. Eph. 6.18. 1 Theſ, 3.10.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant you that expounding of Scripture is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but it is not alike neceſſary for every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to expound Scripture as to pray, Prayer is a piece of naturall worſhip, Preaching a piece of Inſtituted worſhip, and we muſt keep to the Inſtitution, God hath bid all pray, he hath not bid all preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The places of Scripture you quote prove nothing for preaching onely, but for praying, which none denies you; yet you ſet your Scriptures as if they ſhould prove both, but there is no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>Your third argument is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the word doth command it, for it doth every where command to exhort,<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> warne, teach, comfort, reprove, edifie one another, and this cannot be done without the opening and application of Scripture, therefore it is commanded, for it is an undeniable rule; that when any thing is commanded, that alſo is commanded, without which the other thing cannot be done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To bring your argument into forme it muſt be thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That which is commanded is lawfull, <hi>that is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably true.</hi> But the ordinary preaching and expounding of Scriptures by perſons meerely gifted, not called to the office
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118462:60"/> in publike aſſemblies and conſtituted Churches is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Ergo. This I deny Sir.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>You prove it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Where the End is commanded, all neceſſary meanes is commanded: but exhorting, warning, teaching, reproving, edifying one another is an end commanded, and the ordinary preaching and exp unding Scripture by perſons meerely gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not called to the office in publike aſsemblies, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, is the neceſſary meanes to that end? therefore this is commanded.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1: To this I anſwer, Sir, that I grant <hi>God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded private perſons to comfort, reprove, exhort, edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> this is an end commanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>God hath allowed, yea and commanded them the uſe of neceſſary meanes to this end, without which the end could not be attained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay, that although <hi>by publike preaching this end is promoted, yet this is not the onely neceſſary meanes; but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may be edified by their brethren without this,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not follow this is commanded them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Through the ignorance of the preachers, this more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would be a meanes to pervert them:</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This argument would prove, <hi>that they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to adminiſter the Sacraments too, and do all paſtorall acts; for they are commanded, ſay you, to edifie one another, and theſe are meanes of edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This argument would prove, <hi>that all Saints though not gifted nor any wayes proved or approved, may preach and doe all other paſtorall acts, for they are all bound to edifie one another,</hi> and theſe are meanes in order to this end. By this time (Sir) I believe you underſtand your own falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For what you ſay, <hi>that the Scriptures have enjoyned theſe duties, and no where reſtrained time, place, or manner.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that before: there muſt be a time and place too, Sir, obſerved, or elſe you may prove they are bound to preach, when the Miniſter is praying and preaching, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118462:61"/> well as what you doe, and for the manner you your ſelf have ſet downe one, p. 25. and pretended to bring Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it. You ſay you</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Know no reaſon</hi> why they may not ſpeak publikely by exhortation to men, as well as in prayer and praiſe to God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will tell you Sir. 1. Prayer and praiſe <hi>are both pieces of naturall worſhip,</hi> preaching a piece of inſtituted worſhip; in performance of which you muſt keep to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. The Scripture <hi>doth not ſo fully prove, nor indeed at all prove your duty of publike preaching.</hi> 3. <hi>By this argument the vileſt men in the world may, yea and are bound to preach for they are bound</hi> to pray, Acts 8.22.</p>
               <p>Your fourth maine argument as you call it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It being forbidden for women to preach publikely in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.34. 1 Tim. 2.12. <hi>It is ſtrongly implied that it is permitted for men to doe it.</hi> 
                  <q>As the forbidding of certain perſons the entry into the Congregation of the Lord doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply, that all others not forbidden might enter other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that prohibition of the Apoſtle had been alogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and uſeleſſe. For there were at that time no women in office, but extraordinary propheteſses, who did and might ſpeake publikely &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle forbidding onely of women to teach and prophecy gives liberty to all men to expound Scriptures publikly, but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are forbidden to prophecy or teach publikely,</hi> Ergo. 1 Cor. 13 34. 1 Tim. 2.12.</p>
               <p>If any reaſonable ſatisfaction would have ſerved this argument, and the authors and the Abetters of it, it would never have come halting on to the ſtage againe: I know of twice it hath been beaten off. The Browniſts appears with it firſt, holy Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> knockt it downe, in his due right, p. 301. <hi>Chillenden</hi> brought it on againe, the Author of the Booke called Church-members ſet in joint, knockt it downe the ſecond time, p. 30. of that Booke, to it therefore hath beene already anſwered.</p>

                  <q>That the law forbidding women, doth tolerate any man that hath right, and ſo our gifted Brother hath.</q>

               <p>One would thinke here have beene replies enough to ſtop the ſcolding tongue of this <hi>Argument</hi> But to be ſhort your argument lies thus:</p>
               <p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This propoſition is falſe enough, 1. <hi>You muſt prove that theſe men were meerly gifted, as Chriſtians are now gifted, and not in office, nor extraordinarily inſpired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your inſtances of the Elders <hi>Num</hi> 11.23, 24, 25. of <hi>Saul</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.10. of <hi>Stephen,</hi> of <hi>Anna,</hi> of <hi>Apollos,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of the Scribes and Phariſees, of Chriſt, come ſhort here.</p>
               <p>The Elders had the extraordinary gift of prophecy, <hi>Num</hi> 11.23. ſo had <hi>Saul,</hi> and never after ſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ordained and full of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Anna</hi> was a propheteſſe, <hi>Apollos</hi> a <hi>Miniſter. Paul</hi> had received the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. The Scribes and Phariſes <hi>ſate in Moſes chaire</hi> ſaith our Saviour, and ſurely <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe was ſome thing more then a gifted Brother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly you muſt prove <hi>they expounded and applied Scripture,</hi> prove this concerning <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, or <hi>Anna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>You muſt prove they did it in a conſtituted ſettled Church, in which were publike officers;</hi> prove this of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> of the primitive Chriſtians that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, you muſt prove they did it <hi>ordinarily and conſtantly,</hi> prove this of <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> of thoſe ſcattered Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Sir what your argument comes to, not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118462:63"/> one inſtance holds to your caſe, you may ſee fuller an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them in the Bookes which I before cited, when you have diſproved them you may expect an anſwer from them or me.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Simons</hi> or Mr. <hi>Marſton,</hi> whoſe Letters you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, their words are no Oracles, and they have neither anſwered what hath been ſaid againſt it, nor yet favoured us with any arguments for it. Magiſteriall <hi>placets</hi> or friendly <hi>Commendams</hi> are worth little to prove a truth, unleſſe you can aſſure us that they are in them guided by an <hi>infallible Spirit,</hi> which I believe they will hardly ſay they are, they are Gentlemen I know not, they may be learned and holy, but as I take it there be ten for one as learned and holy are of another mind, you are beholden to them for their Letters, but I thinke the truth of God and the Goſpell of Chriſt is not much.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Page 35.</note>In the cloſe of this argument you would know,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What is the difference betweene Preaching and Orations and common placings, ſpeeches, Sermons, and exhortations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>O Sir, take heed of <hi>paralelling the great ordinance</hi> of God to an <hi>Oration</hi> or a <hi>Speech,</hi> this is a very unſavoury paralell to come from one who ſeemes to have ſo much of the feare of God dwelling in him, as you have given the world cauſe to hope you have (from ſome ſober paſſages in your Booke) why doe you not as well ſay what is the difference betweene the word of the <hi>living God and a good Sermon-book?</hi> Betweene <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and reading a godly booke; yet <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay he would burne his bookes if he thought any one would make <hi>that uſe of them.</hi> Suppoſe there be not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall difference, but both be good, yet is there not a great <hi>formall difference,</hi> is not one the Ordinance of God to ſalvation, and are the other publike Ordinances under the like divine appointment: (Deare Sir) take heed of ſuch termes to vilifie this great <hi>Goſpell Ordinance.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Wherein Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> ſeventh and eighth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Lay-preaching are Examined, and one of them found not to conclude Logically. In the handling of the other is examined whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, mentioned in the new Teſtament, be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preaching and expounding Scripture.</head>
               <p>I Am come to your ſixth argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>doth reprove the irregular uſe of this gift in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.14. <hi>and doth direct them in the right uſe of it.</hi>—Ergo.</p>
               <p>Your Logick is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He that doth reprove an irregular uſe of a gift, and direct in the right uſe, doth grant and eſtabliſh an uſe. But the Apoſtle, <hi>1 Cor. 2.14.</hi> doth reprove the irregular uſe of the gift of prophecy, and direct in the right uſe of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both theſe propoſitions are true, I muſt deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which ſhould be thus, or elſe it doth not conclude what you would have it.</p>
               <p>Ergo, The Apoſtle doth grant that gifted men not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the office, may expound Scriptures publikely in a conſtituted Church.</p>
               <p>But Sir, if you conclude thus, I will tell you your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes do not prove your concluſion, and your argument is a paralogiſme, all that you conclude is this: Ergo, The <hi>Apoſtle eſtabliſheth an uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We grant it, that in thoſe times there was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift of prophecy, which the Apoſtle eſtabliſheth the uſe of, and directeth thoſe that had it how to exerciſe it. But what's this to your purpoſe? if you look againe into that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. you will finde that the Apoſtle doth give rules likewiſe to direct in the uſe of the gift of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118462:64"/> Tongues, but doth it therefore follow, that that is a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding continuing gift?</p>
               <p>But I haſten to your ſeventh argument, for in this you have not ſo well lookt as to conclude your queſtion in your concluſion, (ſurely this is not the argument confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Mr. <hi>Marſton,</hi> nor that light that in Mr. <hi>Simons</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould convince the world of this truth) for this argument ſhies at the Monſter and refuſeth to conclude neer it. If I miſtake not, I am now come to <hi>Goliah,</hi> &amp; indeed it is the beſt argument can be brought; yet, if I miſtake not, in the ſtrength of God with a ſling and a ſtone, he may be ſlain too. It is drawn from: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You may all prophecy, that is (ſay you) all amongſt you that have this Propheticall gift, <hi>[prophecy] that is, uſe it [one by one]</hi> that is orderly one after another, that all may be taught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this, <hi>If all that had the gift of prophecy in the primitive times, might prophecy orderly, then all that have the gift, may expound and apply Scriptures now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all that had the gift of prophecy then might</hi>—Ergo. we deny your Major: for two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſay that <hi>that gift of prophecy was an extraordinary guift which none now have,</hi> your argument labours of that fallacy which is call'd <hi>Fallacia equivocationis,</hi> we ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That that prophecying was an act of extraordinary officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By telling us there are two ſorts of Prophets men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, 1. <hi>Such as were to foretell things to come, or reveale Secrets by vertue of an extraordinary calling from God onely, ſuch you ſay were</hi> Agabus, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.17, 18, 19, 20 21. Philips <hi>Daughters, Acts</hi> 21.9. Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Saul, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. Judas, <hi>and</hi> Silas: <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. <hi>the twelve Brethren, Acts</hi> 19.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118462:64"/> 
                  <hi>and they, Math.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.7. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 9 6. All this is true, we will make uſe of it anon; by the way, I hope I ſhall heare of none of theſe Scriptures or inſtances brought to prove the liberty of private brethrens prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cying. But then you tell us:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There were others that improperly and by way of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance called Prophets, either becauſe God did more reveale himſelfe to them then to others, and they had a part of the propheticall gift, ſo Balaam. <hi>2</hi> Pet. <hi>2.16</hi> So Noah was called a Preacher. <hi>2</hi> Pet. <hi>2.5.</hi> ſo ſome were called Singers —ſo the Angell calls himſelfe a prophet, Rev. <hi>22 9.</hi> So the two witneſſes who prophecyed, Rev. <hi>11, 3 4.</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Here now is a tedious confuſed diſcourſe to very little purpoſe. I know not well how to unravell it, there is ſuch a jumbling together of things granted and denied; things true and falſe, and doubtfull. I had beſt (I think) deale with it in this laſt method. And 1. ſhew you what is true, and granted to us. 2. What is falſe and denied by us. 3. What is doubtfull betwixt us. Firſt therefore:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. It is true, <hi>That the Preachers in Office are diſtinguiſhed from Prophets,</hi> Eph. 4.11. 1. Cor. 12.28. neither were they ſuch Prophets.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is falſe that <hi>Balaam</hi> is called a Prophet, as prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying is uſed for expounding and applying Scripture. He foretold things to come, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.5, 6, 7, 8.<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. It is falſe, that thoſe mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. or that prophecying mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 14. were ſuch Prophets as did that thing which you call expounding, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture; or that that was their prophecying, to expound Scripture upon ſtudy and labour.

               <p n="4">4. It is falſe that the term Prophet is any where in the Goſpell either applied to <hi>ſtanding Goſpel-officers,</hi> or to <hi>people.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="9">9. <hi>It is falſe to ſay, that the prophecying and prophets men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi> 1 Cor. ch. 12. ch. 13 ch. 14, &amp;c. is not ceaſed, nor doe your Scriptures prove it, 1 Pet. 12.10. doth not ſo much as mention it.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething doubtfull betwixt us: viz.</p>
               <p>What prophecying of the witneſſes is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, 6.</p>
               <p>By the way before we paſſe on, I deſire the Reader to conſider, how you wind about the Scripture to ſerve your turne. He that runs may read, that in the twelfth, thirtenth, and fourtenth Chapters of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and prophecying, yet you tell us, that the 1 Cor. 14.1, 24.31. 1 Cor. 13.9, 14, 3. are meant of ordinary gifted brethrens expounding: p. 42. but 1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>prophets and prophecying</hi> rationally, muſt be meant in 1 Cor. 12.6, 7, 8. that are meant 1 Cor. 12.28.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118462:66"/> and in 1 Cor. 14.1. that are meant 1 Cor. 14.31. or elſe you muſt ſhew us ſome reaſon in the Text againſt it.</p>
               <p>But according to your own confeſſion, 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Cor. 14.31. are to be underſtood of extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.—Ergo.</p>
               <p>Anſwer me this riddle, keeping your own rule p. 29. <hi>Vbi lex non diſtinguit non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (Sir) now the ſuperfluities of your diſcourſe are pared off; the whole amounts to this, that the prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of, 1 Cor. 14.1. &amp;c. is an ordinary gift ſtill continuing. This you might have ſaid in fewer words: we deny it, you go to prove it, p. 42. 43.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay <hi>it was promiſed:</hi> Joel. 2.18.</p>
               <p>To that place I anſwered before I deny it, that the gift there prophecyed of, was the ordinary gift of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> on my ſide, who ſayes it was meant of thoſe gifts given in the dayes of Pentecoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then dreames and viſions muſt be ordinary too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then daughters muſt alſo prophecy, contrary to the Apoſtles rule, relating to the order of Goſpell Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>But you adde four Reaſons to prove it, let us weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Your firſt reaſon is this: <q>It is reckoned you ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ordinary and continuing gifts, <hi>Ro. 12.6. 1 Cor. 14 1.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Your Argument is this: <hi>That gift which is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ordinary and continuing gifts, is alſo an ordinary and continuing gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the gift of prophecy is ſo reckoned,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.1. Ro. 12.6.</p>
               <p>By the ſame medium I will prove it an extraordinary and not continuing gift, thus: <hi>That gift which is reckoned amongſt extraordinary and not continuing gifts, is alſo an extraordinary and not continuing gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:118462:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this gift of prophecy is reckoned amongſt extraordinary and not continuing gifts.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>It is reckoned with the gifts of healing miracles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Tongues, 1 Cor. 12.9, 10, 28. 1 Cor. 13.1. 1 Cor. 14.1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>So that this argument Sir is too weak, it ſerves as well for me, as you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <q>You ſay all Gods people of all ſorts, and in all times and places are earneſtly to labour for it, and earneſtly deſire it; now if it were an extraordinary gift it were not to be deſired, nor could it be attain'd by induſtry, <hi>1 Cor. 14.39.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Your Logick is this: <hi>That gift that is to be deſired and laboured for by all Saints of all ſorts in all times, is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift.</hi> This is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the gift of propheey mentioned by the Apoſtle, is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for, and deſired by all Saints of all ſorts, in all places.</hi> Ergo. This is denied, you prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What the Corinthians were exhorted to covet and labour for, that all Saints in all times are to labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Corinthians are commanded to Covet and labour for this gift.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>I deny the Major: the Corinthians were to deſire that extraordinary gift. (I read of no labouring commanded) becauſe that gift was then in date, but this command doth not reach us, becauſe it is ceaſed. 2. They were to deſire <hi>tongues and miracles</hi> and the <hi>gift of healing</hi> as well, v. 1. v. 5. they are all comprehended under the Notion of ſpirituall gifts: yet ſurely theſe are not ordinary gifts.</p>
               <p>Your third reaſon is this: <q>What is commanded by a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rule of the Goſpell not to be deſpiſed, is a ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But prophecying is ſo commanded, not to be deſpiſed, <hi>1 Theſ. 5.20. Ergo.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I deny that private expounding Scripture by men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily gifted, is the prophecying here meant, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyings is meant the Ordinances of God, of which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118462:67"/> prophecying was then one, or thoſe expoundings of the myſteries of Scripture, which were then uſually made by ſuch as had received an infallible Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>you tell us, there are many at this day that have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there are many this day can expound Scripture, we deny not; but we queſtion whether there be any can expound it infallibly, as thoſe prophecyers mentioned, 1 Cor. 14. could; being doubtleſſe inſpired and guided by an infallible ſpirit; or that can expound it <hi>extempore</hi> without ſtudy, as doubtleſſe they could; and till you prove thoſe two you cannot prove that there are any now have that gift of prophecy there ſpoken of, which if you doe not prove, you ſay nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For your other Reaſons, p. 43. you doe but repeat what you ſaid before, and I have already anſwered them.</p>
               <p>You ſee (Sir) what weake proofes you have ſerved us with, to prove that the prophecying ſpoken of 1 Cor. 12: ch. 13. ch. 14. this is a common gift. Now you come to anſwer our objections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſay <hi>thoſe prophets were extraordinary officers,</hi> and good reaſon we have to ſay, for they are reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch. Eph. 4.11. 1 Cor. 12.28. and if Eph. 4.11. will prove that Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are officers, it will prove as much for prophets too ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But you deny it at adventures and think that they</hi> were onely ſome choice men that had a gift above others in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Scriptures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That they had a gift above others in expounding Scripture is queſtionleſſe true, for doubtleſſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by revelation, 1 Cor. 14.26. and <hi>infallibly.</hi> But that they were not extraordinary officers, I cannot grant you, you offer us ſeverall reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There <hi>were ſuch in the primitive times, as the</hi> 70. Lu. "10.1. <hi>and thoſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:118462:68"/>
               <p>I doe not know how to expound this terme <hi>ſuch:</hi> if you meane ſuch as could expound Scripture <hi>extempore,</hi> and by an infallible ſpirit, I yeild it, but that theſe were not in office you have not proved.<note place="margin">V. <hi>Chemnit.</hi> ad loc.</note> Surely the ſeventy were, for Lu. 10.1.

                  </gap>, if Chriſt could put them in office, they were in office. It is <hi>gratis dictum</hi> to ſay thoſe, 1 Cor. 12.31, 14, 1. were not in office. But you ſay.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>2.</hi> If they ſhould be officers of that Church only, then did Paul write that Epiſtle confuſedly: not diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt officers and people.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I know none ſay that Prophets were officers of this or that Church, onely I believe their office was larger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (Sir) is of age, let him anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But indeed:</p>
               <p n="3">3. The confuſion is only in your own head and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes plaine enough to diſtinguiſh, 1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 28.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>3. You ſay</hi> this prophecying is diſtinguiſhed from the Church officer, and his gifts.—<hi>Rom. 12.6, 7, 8 and it is</hi> there called a gift.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer the Apoſtle there makes a diſtribution of Church officers; ſome are extraordinary, theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under prophecying; ſome ordinary, theſe are comprehended under Miniſtring.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly it is no more call'd a gift; then exhorting and miniſtring, ruling, and giving and ſhewing mercy is, but ſurely ſome of theſe were officers.</p>

               <p n="4">4. You <hi>tell us the Officers of the Church were but few,</hi> how doth that appeare? perſons extraordinarily gifted and in office, might be many, though officers in our Church that are ſtanding be not.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:118462:68"/>
               <p>But you ſay, admit the Prophets mentioned be not ſuch as our guifted brethren, yet the prophecying you plead for is.</p>
               <p>Surely (Sir) if you quit the name and the officer, you muſt alſo quit the act too. But let us heare what you ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">"1. You tell us, <hi>thoſe that were no Prophets might prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe this were true, yet the queſtion is, whether the prophecying mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23 24. &amp;c. be not the act of thoſe Prophets mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. if it be, you have loſt your cauſe, except you can prove the brethren ſuch Prophets.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have not proved <hi>that any prophecyed but Prophets.</hi> That is, ſuch as were by divine exordinary inſpiration enlightned; or by miſſion ſent and obliged to doe it.

               <p>We can tell you, that many more learned and godly men have thought otherwiſe, and ſo we are even with you: yea we have the odds.</p>
               <p>I told you that <hi>All</hi> muſt be reſtrained in that paſſage, <hi>You may all prophecy.</hi> You tell me no: for it is contrary to the tenor of the words. Yet in the very next words you reſtrain it to your ſelfe: to all <hi>that have the guift of prophecy.</hi> I ask no more.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more in your ſeventh Argument, but what is repeated over and over again, and hath already received its anſwer. I come to your eighth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Wherein the <hi>47, 48, 49, 50</hi> p. of Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> book are examined, and his two laſt Arguments found—<hi>Non ſequiturs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe ſubſtance of it brought into form, is this: <hi>Thoſe men that are fitted and furniſhed with abilities from God to open and apply Scriptures in a conſtituted Church pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, thoſe may doe it.</hi> For you ſay, <hi>God hath done nothing in vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there are many private perſons whom God hath fitted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118462:69"/> and furniſhed with abilities to this worke, who are not called and ſet apart:</hi> Ergo they may doe it.</p>
               <p>Heark a little, and tell me how this kind of arguing ſounds in your eares: <hi>Thoſe who are fitted with abilities to be Generals of an Army, or Parliament men, or pleaders at the bar, may doe the work of Generals and Parliament men, and plead at the bar:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But many Colonels in the Army are <hi>fitted with abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to execute the office of a Generall: And there be many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have abilities to doe the work of Parliament men; and many Lawyers have the abilities to doe the work of Iudges; and many that are not called to the bar have abilities to plead:</hi> Ergo they may doe all theſe.</p>
               <p>In earneſt (Sir) if my Lord Generall hath you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for him, or the honourable houſe of Parliament ſet you to diſpute for them, or the Judges or Lawyers for them, I will undertake in an houre you will diſpute them all out of their places; <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> could not make a better argument againſt them.</p>
               <p>To anſwer you directly: Preaching (Sir) is an office, and he that may do it, muſt beſides inward abilities have an outward call, and ſetting apart; as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had, as <hi>Timothy</hi> had, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I will proceed to your ninth Argument. <q>
                     <hi>You ſay,</hi> There have been, and are many learned and godly men who have held the lawfulneſſe of the thing.</q> You inſtance in Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and the five Apologiſts.</p>
               <p>Logically thus, What ſome learned and godly men "have held lawfull, that is lawfull:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſome learned and godly men have held it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for perſons meerly gifted, not called and ſet apart to the work of the Miniſtry, nor intending it, to expound and apply Scripture ordinarily; <hi>Ergo it is lawfull.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I deny your major. Surely we doe not deny infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and give it ſome few ſingle perſons.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I believe you will not grant my argument: yet I take ſome of theſe to be as learned and holy as thoſe you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in.</p>
               <p>(Sir) Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and the five Apologiſts are learned and reverent men, but not without their miſtakes; and they are all parties in that caſe; we are as ready to argue it againſt them as you: their <hi>placet</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith right, that it is onely to be conſidered, <hi>Quid Chriſtus qui ante omnes fuit faciendum putavit,</hi> what Chriſt who is before and above all ſaith.</p>
               <p>Your laſt Argument is this, <hi>That which may have very good ends and fruits is lawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this practice may have very good ends and fruits,</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>I deny your major. We muſt not doe evill (ſaith the Apoſtle) that good may come of it. The meanes muſt be good, as well as the end.</p>
               <p>An Argument is as good againſt you thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. 48, 49.</hi> Quemadmodum inauſpicatus eſt medicus qui oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendo homines diſcit mederi, ita non eſt optanda prudentia quae laedendo diſcit prodeſſe. <hi>Eraſm.</hi>

                  <hi>That which may have very ill and pernicious ends, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this practice may have ſo,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Yea, how many are led into errours, and hereſies, and blaſphemies thus, let this age witneſſe. You reckon eight good ends and fruits of this: I doe not think it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means to any one of them ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay <hi>the Church may be edified by it, and unbelievers converted.</hi> And (Sir) may not the Church be thus deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverted? Conſider experience a little: ſhew us where God hath laid this prophecying (as you call it) under a divine appointment to this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay <hi>hereby men may be fitted and tried for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:118462:70"/> How (Sir) by preaching publiquely and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; or rather by ſtudying the Scriptures, and preaching once or twice, or more, before <hi>Timothy,</hi> who is able to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay <hi>hereby the Doctrine of the Goſpell will be kept pure,</hi> contrary to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, it were eaſie to anſwer all you pretend to ſay in this thing: But, 1. Experience anſwers it ſufficiently that it would have no ſuch fruit. 2. If in reaſon we might hope for ſuch an iſſue, yet Gods ends muſt be proſecuted and attained by his owne waies.</p>
               <p>You ſhut up this Chapter, by telling us what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you doe not ſtand upon: I hope I have ſhewed you as much reaſon (Sir) to quit theſe you have inſiſted upon, which I am ſure conclude not what you would have, any more then thoſe Arguments you have quitted doe.</p>

               <p>THe firſt objection you pretend to anſwer is partly mine and partly ſome of my other reverend brethrens.</p>
               <p>We had charged you with this Argument:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What things muſt (by Scripture-warrant) onely be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to others in publique aſſemblies by faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others, and to whom ſuch things ſhall be committed by Timothies and Pauls; thoſe things

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the truths of the Goſpell are ſuch as according to Scripture-warrant are onely to be communicated to others by ſuch as being faithfull and able to teach others, and have thoſe things committed to them by Timothies; and private perſons are not ſuch to whom theſe things are ſo committed.</q> Ergo.</p>
               <p>To prove the Major I inſtanced in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. and ſhewed the force of it <hi>p.</hi> 40. I alluded to that place, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. but not as a proofe on which I much inſiſted.</p>
               <p>My brother <hi>Hall</hi> hath not inſtanced this Argument in his firſt Edition of his Pulpit-guard. The other Editions I have not.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee if you have ſufficiently anſwered this Argument, which is chiefly founded on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. though 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.18.6.20. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.3. prove a part of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You anſwer by way of conceſſion, telling us, that you grant ſuch an officer as a preaching Miniſter, and tell us that they are more eminent preachers. <q>
                     <hi>And</hi> ſomething is undoubtedly committed to, and required of them, as to the preſervation and promulgation of the Word of God, over and above what is required of and committed to men out of office.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are bound to it ex officio by their office, others not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are bound to doe it more lively and vigorouſly then others.</hi> Ro. 10.14. Eſ. 40.9. Eſ. 48.1. Ro. 9.27. Mat. 3.3. Jo. 7.37, 38.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They may preach with authority.</hi> Titus 2.15. 2 Theſ. 3.6. 1 Tim. 5.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They may doe it with continuance, they may make it their calling and whole worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Theſ. 5.12. 1 Tim. 3 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They are to aſſume the whole office to adminiſter the ſeales alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you ſay ſecondly, that <hi>the Texts are not excluſive but private men may doe it too.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:118462:72"/>
               <p>Thirdly, you ſpend a great deale of time and paper to vindicate that text. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. p. 54, 55. and thoſe places <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15.</p>
               <p>Having thus analyſed your anſwer, in the next place let me come to examine the ſtrength of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From what you have granted us, I gather:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are to be ſome Preachers in office,</hi> and to theſe onely it belongs to adminiſter the Sacraments, and theſe are onely to preach authoritatively, vigorouſly, <hi>ex officio,</hi> conſtantly, making it their work. This is all a great truth then it ſeems.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That for guifted brethren, <hi>they may doe it, or they may let it alone,</hi> it is but an <hi>act of liberty in them;</hi> yet you told us before it was their duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may doe it <hi>coldly, and poorly, and lazily:</hi> for the preacher is onely bound to doe it <hi>vigorouſly</hi> and <hi>lively,</hi> p. 52. and <hi>earneſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They can onely preach <hi>precariouſly,</hi> for they have no <hi>authority,</hi> and cannot do it <hi>authoritatively,</hi> Titus 2.15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They muſt not make it their whole work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Surely our guifted brethren will give you little thanks for your conceſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Surely all people that are in their right wits will take heed of hearing theſe guifted brethren, that at the moſt can but preach <hi>coldly and lazily,</hi> without <hi>authority</hi> or any <hi>vigour,</hi> without due <hi>meditation</hi> and ſtudy. Surely the countenance and bleſſing of God is moſt likely to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe that come in the name of God, and with his authority, and can command in the Lords name.</p>
               <p>But you ſay that the Texts are not <hi>excluſive,</hi> though they doe plainly hint that thoſe that preach the Goſpell <hi>ſhould have it committed to them:</hi> yet you think that ſome may preach that have it not committed, and ſo you would make my argument a fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum fimpliciter.</hi> But ſir, I reply upon you:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neither are any Scriptures excluſive in ſo many
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118462:73"/> words that you bring to prove that they may not <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments,</hi> and that they may not preach <hi>with authority,</hi> nor make it <hi>their work;</hi> yet this you grant us, and upon good grounds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What the Scriptures doe not ſay, that none may doe in the worſhip of God:</hi> for we muſt not adde to Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But the Scriptures (although they ſay preachers in office may and ought to preach to others) <hi>yet no where ſay that the guifted brethren may doe it.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>The Scripture plainely ſayes, that thoſe that teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt not onely be <hi>able and faithfull, but muſt have the Scriptures committed to them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See your own rule, p. 45. <hi>Generaliter dictum, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                  </note> this (Sir) is <hi>excluſive</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you can bring another Scripture that proves <hi>they may teach others,</hi> though they have not thoſe things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them: And beſides the Apoſtle plainely ſpeakes <hi>de re</hi> of the thing, not <hi>de modo</hi> of the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>teach others,</hi> you put in <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, vigorouſly,</hi> &amp;c. Bring us a Scripture that ſayes that gifted brethren may <hi>teach others publikely,</hi> for that is plainly meant there, if you cannot, this Text is proofe enough againſt you. Your ſimilitudes prove nothing.</p>
               <p>By your anſwer I would infer, that all the Acts of Church officers may be done by private perſons, becauſe the Scriptures, that ſay they ought to doe them, doe not ſay, others ought not.</p>
               <p>The third part of your anſwer lies in a vindication of that Text, Mal. 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the people ſhould require the Law at his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Critically telling us the words are better read, <hi>the Prieſts lips did preſerve knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ſome read them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is not excluſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the caſe of people under the Law and Goſpell differ.</hi> For my own part I was aware of your laſt anſwer, and therefore did not inſiſt upon that place; yet now you
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118462:73"/> have brought it upon the ſtage, let me take its part a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſee if you have done it no wrong.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay that thoſe words, Mal. 2.7. which we tranſlate. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhall preſerve knowledge,</hi> are read by ſome, <hi>The Prieſts lips did preſerve knowledge,</hi> and this reading beſt agrees with the coherence of the words antecedent and ſubſequent, I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true <hi>Piſcator</hi> doth ſo tranſlate it, and make the ſenſe what you ſay, but he is the onely man I finde doing it: <hi>Tremellius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Gualter,</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> Our late <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,</hi> &amp;c. Tranſlate it ſhall or ſhould, and this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.12. (which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> quotes as paralell.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, aske the Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law,</hi> &amp;c. So that you ſee for one authority, for you, we have found ſeven againſt you. But let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Hebrew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The word is there in the future tence, and properly to be tranſlated, <hi>ſhall,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>ſhould,</hi> and although it be a truth that the Hebrewes doe ſometimes confound tenſes and we often tranſlate their future tenſe by the preterperfect, yet (with ſubmiſſion to thoſe more learned and criticall in that language) I conceive it ſhould not be ſo tranſlated, except the ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth it, the primary and proper ſignification being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither doe I ſee ſuch a neceſſity for the coherence ſake ſo to tranſlate it there;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> Our Annot.</note> for might not the Prophet as well ſet out their impiety by their declination from their duty, as well as from the piety of the Prieſts formerly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nay under favour (Sir) the coherence is both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you and <hi>Piſcator</hi> too, the very next words are,— <hi>for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts;</hi> now let any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man judge whether the ſenſe be better as you would have it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Prieſts lips did keep knowledge, and they did ſeeke
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118462:74"/> the Law at his mouth, for he is the Angell of the Lord of hoſts,</hi> or as we read it,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeeke the Law at his mouth.</hi> For he is the Angell of the Lord of hoſts: or the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts for the ſame word ſignifies both: this is the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why the people ſhould enquire the interpretation of the Law at his mouth, becauſe he is the <hi>Meſsenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he is one authorized and ſent and appointed by God to open the Law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But Fifthly, ſuppoſe we admit your reading, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the caſe at all, for you grant that the Prieſts lips did keep knowledge, and the people did require the Law at his mouth: and this in the purer ſtate of the Jewiſh Church, and this was a piece of their ſinne that they were deviated from this practiſe, this is as much as we deſire, ſurely the Jewiſh Church order was not altered, but by their corruption in <hi>Malachies</hi> time, if we take your ſenſe it amounts to this.</p>
               <p>In the old time, <hi>The Prieſts lips did preſerve knowledge, and they did require the law at his mouth, who was the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> But now the Prieſts are ignorant, and the people profane, <hi>they care for no Prieſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſt able to interpret the Law of the Lord,</hi> (for they were deviated as well as the Prieſts.) v. 11.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Have not you warded this Text well think you (Sir?) It is as if we ſhould ſay of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Prelates times the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus preached plainely and powerfully and conſtantly, they preached Law and Goſpell reproofes, and exhortations, and the people heard the word of God diligently and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently, and were content to teach their families, and to repeat Sermons, and then the power of godlineſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and Chriſtians kept in the Vnity of the ſpirit and the bond of peace, and walkt humbly with God, and hated Arminian and Socinian, and familiſticall Errors
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118462:74"/> and Blaſphemies, and were kept under an aw of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>But now many Miniſters are come to preach notions, and allegories, and whimzies, to read Sermons inſtead of preaching, to lay aſide preaching duty and reproofe, and to preach nothing but priviledges and myſteries and nonſenſicall notions, and to preach once a fortnight. And the people they are come to neglect and deſpiſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, to thinke themſelves as much preachers as the Miniſters, and to know as much as they can tell them, and hence they are puft up with pride, and are taken in the ſnare of the Devill, and are continually rending and di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viding one from another, and running into error and blaſphemies; and the whole Nation of profeſſors almoſt is turn'd Arminian, Socinian, or Familiſticall.</p>
               <p>You have put the interpretation (Sir) upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, I have to ſtrengthen our argument helpt you with a parallell, <hi>Quam bene conveniunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To your ſecond anſwer in which you point us to <hi>Deodate</hi> for a note, but you have abuſed him, for he hath never a note upon the words you quote. I grant you the words onely held to us, <hi>Analogically;</hi> but where is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy, if not here? as the Prieſts were the onely ordinary perſons that had the knowledge of the Law, betruſted to them to communicate it to others, and the people were not to go to ſeeke it at an ordinary Jewes mouth, but at the publike officers mouth, ſo the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell are the only ordinary perſons under the Goſpell, that have the Goſpell committed to them to teach others out of it, and Goſpell Chriſtians are not to require the opening of thoſe Myſteries at one anothers mouthes, but at theirs.</p>
               <p>But you tell us thirdly, the <hi>Caſe is otherwiſe under the Law and Goſpell.</hi> I grant you all you ſay there, onely I do not finde that Iſ. 61.8. the people of God are called Prieſts, nor doe I believe that all people generally come
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118462:75"/> under thoſe promiſes: you mention onely Saints, and I turne your argument upon your ſelfe thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If under the Goſpell people be generally more full of knowledge then under the Law, then they had need have more eminent a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble teachers, that ſhould give them ſtrong meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe, Sir, had need be ſuch as are able to ſearch the deeps of Scripture, to dive into the hidden myſteries.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as knowledge encreaſeth, ſo in ſome wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will encreaſe, and the Goſpell preachers had need be ſuch as ſhall be able to <hi>oppoſe thoſe that gaineſay</hi> their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in oppoſing thoſe that contradict a truth.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that maintaine a diſpute either for a truth, or for an errour, had need have ſome more abilities then unlearned gifted brethren.</p>
               <p>A late experience of this I could tell you in the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red company at <hi>Bury,</hi> where were many thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able enough to <hi>Preach,</hi> but being challenged by the Reverend paſtor of the Presbyterian Church, to diſpute a point, which they might have beene well verſed in (for I believe the perſons have been ſtudying it, and practiſing it theſe ſeven years) whether the Miniſters <hi>of England be true Miniſters: they were glad to ſend for ſome of their Norfolk Brethren for helpe,</hi> and ſome of the gifted brethren went, and when they returned (being miſerably bafled) by their owne confeſſion they ſaid they wanted a <hi>Scholler,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe they thought they had the ſpirit of God, but God will convince men, learning is his Ordinance to enable men both to expound Scripture and defend his truth.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place you come to the Commiſſion, Math. 28.19. Mar. 16.15.</p>
               <p>From which both my Brother <hi>Hall</hi> and my ſelfe urged you to ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">"1. <hi>That the word may be read, go make diſciples,</hi> Jo. 4.1.</p>
               <p n="2">"2. <hi>There is no negative Clauſe in it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="4">4. You tell us <hi>the people have a commiſſion to teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>
                     <hi>5.</hi> That the native ſenſe of the place ſeems only an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former commiſſion. <hi>Mat. 10.1, 2. Lu 10.1, 2.</hi>

                     <hi>6.</hi> That the force of the word lieth not ſo much in enabling them to the act which they might have done before, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To your firſt cavill,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> Novar. ad loc.</note> that the word may be tranſlated <hi>Goe make Diſciples:</hi> I anſwer, and it may be read <hi>Goe preach:</hi> it may be tranſlated, Go be Diſciples, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. Scapulam ad loc.</hi> But becauſe a word hath many ſignifications, doth it follow that any of them may be the ſenſe of that place where it is uſed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe it ſhould be tranſlated ſo: how is one made a Diſciple, but by <hi>converſion?</hi> and when is a man converted, but when he is brought to believe, and <hi>faith comes by hearing;</hi> then from hence will follow that the ſame thing is meant, yea and ſomething more. That thoſe that the Lord intends ordinarily to honour with the converſion of ſoules to himſelfe, muſt be <hi>commiſſion-officers</hi> in the buſineſſe of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond cavill, <hi>that the Commiſſion is not literally excluſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it excludes them from baptizing, it excludes them for preaching; but you grant the former.</p>
               <p>To your third, that in <hi>common reaſon they are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> What you meane (Sir) by <hi>common Reaſon,</hi> I cannot tell. Socinian and Eraſtian reaſon wil not exclude them: but ſanctified reaſon that teacheth the ſoule to take heed of thruſting its name into a commiſſion, and doing any thing for which is not plain ground in Scripture, this will exclude them. But you tell us,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though a Commiſſion be given to ſome to be Juſtices of the peace, yet doth not this exclude others from keeping the peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Your ſimilitude is no proofe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It halts ſhamefully. Preaching is a piece of inſtituted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118462:76"/> worſhip, where the rules of inſtitution muſt be kept; but keeping the peace is not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is falſe, and the fallacy lies in <hi>keeping the peace.</hi> Every one is <hi>bound to keep the peace,</hi> as to his own <hi>private practice,</hi> not to be riotous: but every one is not to command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to keep the peace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſtables</hi> (Sir) are <hi>officers,</hi> and ſo bound by office to keep the peace, and ſee it kept, and may doe ſomething more then Juſtices. But your guifted brethren are no officers at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Chriſt (you ſay) gave his Apoſtles commiſſion to heale the ſicke, <hi>Mat. 10 8.</hi> might not others therefore that had this guift heale them?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not proper to ſay, <hi>healing the ſick was an office, and the Apoſtles had a commiſſion, it was a rare guift to which they had a power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Supponis quod non ſupponendum eſt.</hi> No other had that guift.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any other ſhould have gone to a ſick perſon and pretended to heale miraculouſly, ſaying as <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 3.6. <hi>In the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ariſe and walk,</hi> he ſhould have ſinn'd againſt God.</p>
               <p>I am ſick of your ſimilitudes: to goe on therefore to your third Cavill, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"That the people have a commiſſion to teach, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then Sir? The commiſſion 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 22. <hi>to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Matth. 28.20. to <hi>teach all Nations.</hi> Shew us where they have ſuch a Commiſſion. They may teach by private exhortations, by an holy life; not by publique expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and doctrines: ſhew us where their commiſſion to this lies.</p>
               <p>To your fourth cavill. Suppoſe it were but an <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtles Commiſſion,</hi> yet it was the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion that authorized them to preach the Goſpell <hi>to all Nations,</hi> or to any but Jews; and the originall copy of the Goſpell preachers commiſſion. Thus much your ſelfe confeſſe, we ask no more.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:118462:76"/>
               <p>To your fifth cavill I anſwer: That the force of that word lies in enabling them to preach the Goſpell to any ſort and condition of people, &amp; in eſtabliſhing a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtanding office of Goſpel-Preachers, with whom Chriſt promiſeth to be to the end of the world; not as you would ſeem to hint, onely in laying it upon them as a duty, which yet was the liberty of all beſides them. Your places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17, 18. ſerve to prove what none denies you, that we muſt preach; but they will not prove that all may preach, nor that the force of that word <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. is no more then you would have it, for they have no reference at all to that place, warranted by Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But you tell us,</hi> That Miniſters muſt attend to preaching, and make it their work; which guifted brethren are not bound to doe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They are beholding to you for juſtifying their lazy preaching; but God and his word are not much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you for this patronage of lazy, idle, unwarranted <hi>extempore</hi> preachers.</p>
               <p>Thus (Sir) you may ſee how ſlight an anſwer you think to ſtop the mouth of our firſt Argument with.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond objection as you ſay is, <q>That men that have not skill in the originall Tongues cannot underſtand, much leſſe interpret the Scriptures, much leſſe can they divide the word of God aright.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer: 1. <q>That we grant, that although they be not skilled in School-learning, if called, they may preach.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>2.</hi> That many of the Preachers in office this day doe not underſtand the Tongues.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>
                     <hi>3.</hi> That ſomething in the Scripture may be underſtood without the knowledge of the Tongues.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">"4. <hi>That many great Schollers ſee little of Gods mind in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>
                     <hi>5.</hi> That the knowledge of heavenly truths is attainable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118462:77"/> only by the Spirit of God, not by any humane power or ſtrength <hi>1 Cor. 2.14. Upon which you enlarge,</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <q>
                     <hi>6.</hi> That many that have little of this learning, yet have much divine Learning, and a large underſtanding of the Word of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <q>
                     <hi>7.</hi> That to divide the word of God aright, is to divide to every one their portion from the word, and to fit it to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtates and conditions of people that heare it: and this may be done without much humane learning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To all this I anſwer, 1. Generally. 2. Particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">

                  </note>1. Generally. This is none of my Argument. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hall</hi> doth hint it, p. 19. but Sir, (if you mean him) you wrong him, for his propoſition is this: Thoſe that want <hi>learning, both humane and divine, cannot be ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, nor ſolid diſputants.</hi> You have ſet up a man of ſtraw, and then fall to puſhing of him.

               <p>I ſhall not Engliſh it, ſuppoſing you underſtand Latine, I could furniſh you with many more of his minde. But I ſay, I cannot ſay that a knowledge in the Tongues is <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary to me to interpret any Scriptures, but thus much we ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that hath not skill in the Tongues muſt take the credit of expoſitors and tranſlators, and if they quarrell, he will ſcarce know which ſide to take.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He will never know the full Emphaſis of Scripture, many ſweet notions of truth lie in the various ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the originall words, which Tranſlators could not hint us being to give the word only one tranſlation: v. <hi>Hyperium de ſtudio theol:</hi> c. 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are many miſtakes in tranſlations and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are many proper idiomes of Languages: which tranſlators cannot expreſſe. But for an abſolute neceſſity in all caſes I doe not hold it. Though I could heartily wiſh that all preachers might be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118462:78"/> the Originall Languages, and I thinke ſomething this way is hinted us by Gods furniſhing the firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell with the gift of Tongues.</p>
               <p>And as light as you make Sir of humane learning, if you come to argue a Scripture againſt an oppoſer, that is learned, he will make you believe you had need of the Tongues, and of Logick too, and that preacher is worth little that durſt not appeare, or is not able to defend <hi>his own doctrine:</hi> nor doe I think ſuch for conſtant ordinary preachers are Gods Ordinance: indeed caſes of neceſſity have no Law. Better have one onely to read Scriptures then none either to read or preach, and ſo better have preachers that can but preach other mens Sermons and Expoſitions, then no preachers at all: This I anſwer ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally: now to your Cavills.</p>
               <p>To your firſt I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We onely ſay, <hi>it may be in caſes of neceſſity,</hi> when ſuch as are more fit cannot be had, then let ſuch be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as have not ſuch skill in School-learning.

               <p>To your Third cavill I anſwer two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. I know not one Scripture can be underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding the Language it was wrote in, <hi>but he that expounds it muſt take the credit of the Tranſlator,</hi> and we know Tranſlations are not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> and ſo conſequently the minde of God, by comparing it with the Analogy of Faith; thus indeed the thing may be knowne to be true, but not a Truth in that Text; ſhall he know it by the coherence? and how ſhall he underſtand that without a skill in the Languages, except he takes it upon truſt, ſuppoſe there be no coherence, as in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Surely a preacher ſhould be able to open the whole counſell of God, not this or that ſingle Text.</p>
               <p>To your fourth cavill. viz. <q>If humane learning be ſuch an helpe to the knowledge of Scriptures, what is the reaſon that ſome yea many great Schollers look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scripture and ſee little of Gods mind in it, and how comes it to paſſe that many who are without humane learning have ſo large a knowledge and underſtanding hereof.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He that will thus uſe theſe meanes and lay aſide the perverſe opinion and prejudice of his own wit and parts, which many uſe upon all occaſions, he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, the ſpirit doth guide into the knowledge of all truth, yet not ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That any one may or ought to take any expoſition as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But ſo as, that it oft works in me an infallible perſwaſion of this or that truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But this the <hi>Spirit doth upon the uſe of meanes,</hi> not <hi>without humane power and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Spirit doth helpe us to the knowledge</hi> of much truth, by bringing to remembrance what we have heard, Jo. 14.26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We grant you, none are ſo fit to preach and expound Scriptures, as thoſe that have the Spirit of God: if they alſo have a capacity to uſe all other meanes which God hath appointed, and that humane learning meeting with a conceited proud ſoule, may prejudice a Chriſtian in underſtanding and ſeeking the will of God.</p>
               <p>All this ſome of your Scriptures prove, though let me tell you ſome of your Scriptures prove neither what you would have nor this neither, nor any thing like it, as Rom. 8.5, 6. Jude 19. Jo. 17.15, 16. Acts 13.48. But what is all this to prove the two great things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Spirit of God dwelling in us onely can teach the ſoule <hi>the proper and literall meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and capacitate one to expound it to another,</hi> though indeed to that there muſt be a common work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as a ſpirit of illumination. Or Secondly:</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſpirit <hi>doth this without meanes,</hi> without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Not a Scripture of all you bring, prove either of theſe, and ſo you have ſaid a great deale to little purpoſe, your ſixth cavill is the very ſame with your fourth.</p>
               <p>To your ſeventh I anſwer: It is indeed part of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that phraſe <hi>dividing the word</hi> of God aright, to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118462:81"/> give every one their portion, but how ſhall the unlearned doe this, if they doe not know what portion the word hath for them, and how ſhall they know that, if they doe not know the ſenſe of the words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Surely the underſtanding the parts of the Chapter, and ſeverall things contained in the Text, muſt goe to dividing the word of God aright. I have done with this; I come to your reply to the Third objection.</p>

                  <q>Some of thoſe you ſay are incommunicable, and to be done by none elſe: ſome communicable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To all this I anſwer, we onely ſpeake of <hi>Proper acts of office,</hi> and thoſe are ſuch as belong to him and none elſe, and ſo Prayer, Reading, Writing, and Church governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118462:82"/> are not, Chriſt never ſaid, go Read and Baptize, or Write and Baptize, or Rule and Baptize, though we grant all thoſe to belong to him, yet they are not proper Acts of his office <hi>quà a Goſpell Preacher,</hi> ſo he hath but two proper Acts that I know, viz 1. <hi>Publike preaching.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Seales,</hi> thoſe that are for Epiſcopacy adde a third, but we conceive that belongs not to him alone (except other officers be wanting.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you come to tell us what it is <hi>to be in office as</hi> a Preacher: ſo you ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">"1. <hi>He muſt be lawfully called and authorized thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>2.</hi> He muſt be over ſome people being duly called to them, for if Miniſter and people be Correlatives, then can there be no Miniſter in office untill he be engaged to ſome people. And till then he ſeemes to be onely in the Nature of a gifted man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that it is true that <hi>Miniſter and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are correlates,</hi> but to what people is a Miniſter a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate? what to this or that Church onely? I deny that: he is in office as a Goſpell preacher, to any people in the world; paſtors and teachers are in office, for the whole body of Chriſt, Eph. 4.11.12. when he is engaged to a particular people, he is but appropriated, not by that conſtituted a Miniſter, for if a miniſter be onely in office to his own Church,</p>
               <p n="1">1: He can <hi>adminiſter the Sacrament to no ſingle perſon that is not a fixt member of his Church.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>But to make haſt, p. 63. you tell us five things which you conceive uſurpations of the Goſpell preachers office. I agree with you in all of them, onely I muſt ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That preaching is the proper Act of a Preachers office, and ſo incommunicable,</hi> and if I make good what I have ſaid to this purpoſe, you are condemned out of your own mouth.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, in my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> I produced three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, p. 34 35, 36, 37. you have anſwered not one of them; onely you ſay,</p>
               <p>We ſay <hi>that it is as much his proper act as Baptiſme;</hi> Truth, I did ſo, and proved it, <hi>becauſe the ſame commiſſion authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth to both.</hi> 2. Saint <hi>Paul ſeemeth to lay more upon it then upon</hi> Baptizing, 1 Cor. 1.17. to neither of theſe doe you ſay a word.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument I urged you with was this, <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acts of Elders, Biſhops, Stewards of the myſteries of God, Heralds, Embaſſadours, Watchmen, extraordinary Deacons, Paſtors, Teachers,</hi> are acts of office,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is their proper act,</hi> ſee Scriptures, p. 24.</p>
               <p>Third Argument, <hi>Either this is their proper act, or they have no proper act. But God did not ordaine an office with no act proper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have nothing to ſay againſt this, unleſſe you ſay Baptizing and giving the Supper is their proper act, and then I require one Scripture to prove either of theſe a more proper act then preaching, ſee <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> p. 37. To none of theſe you anſwer.</p>
               <p>So that for all that you have ſaid, our argument ſtands ſtrong, and will do ſo till you bring us a plaine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a good argument from Scripture to prove that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118462:83"/> God hath appointed Goſpell preachers, ſome acts that are more proper to them then preaching.</p>

               <p>THe next argument you pretend to anſwer is my 1 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and the ſubſtance of my Brothers <hi>Halls</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, eighth, and ninth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You ſay, we ſay <hi>you may not doe it becauſe you are not called and ſent by the Preſbytery,</hi> as Ro. 10.15. 1 Tim. 3.10.4, 14.5.22, 2.2, 3.</q> It is the Scripture ſaith ſo. (Sir) not we onely. To this you anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. <hi>That you will not now diſpute the Preſbytery, nor thus call to the Miniſtry,</hi> no (Sir) it is not your beſt courſe, believe it, <hi>Swords and Piſtols,</hi> will ſerve you better in that worke then Scripture and Reaſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You agree that <hi>preachers in office muſt be duly called,</hi> none of them Scriptures ſay (Sir) <hi>preachers in office,</hi> but thoſe that preach muſt be ſent, Ro. 10. thoſe that <hi>teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others</hi> muſt be not onely faithfull and able, but <hi>have the Goſpell committed to them,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2.</p>
               <p>But you <hi>hold it convenient if not neceſſary;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt (Sir) is beholden to you for drawing out duties into <hi>conveniences,</hi> I ſuppoſe you hold it <hi>convenient too,</hi> that the Goſpell ſhould be Preached and people heare and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it will be found neceſſary one day (Sir) Jeſus Chriſt will make you aſhamed of that ſame <hi>if not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But the places onely</hi> ſpeak of a call from God: <hi>and then</hi> a man is ſent of <hi>God when he is</hi> fit and able to teach. <hi>2. hath</hi> a willingneſſe in his minde to give himſelfe to the worke. <hi>3 when</hi> providence diſpoſeth him to a call to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his gift.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:118462:84"/>
               <p>I profeſſe I tremble to read and heare men profeſſing to the feare of God ſo boldly contradicting his word, trampling upon his plaine precepts, and all to exalt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corrupt reaſon. But to anſwer a little.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If that be a call from God which you inſtance in, I beſeech you Sir, with what face of a Chriſtian can you ſay, moſt of the Scriptures quoted ſpeak of no more? there are but five Scriptures in all, 1 Tim. 3.10. <hi>And let theſe alſo be proved?</hi> who ſhould prove them, good Sir?) 1 Tim. 4.14. With <hi>the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery,</hi> is there no call from men thinke you? The third is 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> what is that <hi>meant of Gods immediate ſending,</hi> thinke you, doth he lay hands on any? the fourth is 1 Tim. 2.2.—the ſame <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thou to faithfull men who ſhall be able to teach others,</hi> is God meant by that <hi>thou</hi> thinke you (Sir?) the fifth place quoted firſt is Rom. 10.15. that indeed is not ſo plaine, but carnall reaſon hath more roome to cavill; but I have ſpoke enough before to cleare that from the Socinian gloſſe of providentiall ſending: you tell us p. 66. you <hi>have cleared that Text, and ſhall adde no more.</hi> But truly (Sir) except you had ſpake more to the purpoſe before, you might have added your pleaſure: but you ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>If theſe places be admitted in the ſenſe we would have them,</hi> then it would follow that none might preach in any caſe but ſuch as are examined and approved by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and that we dare not affirm, for we admit it in diverſe caſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In none but in caſes of neceſſity (Sir) and in ſuch caſes your note is falſe, for though believing actually be the ordinary meanes of ſalvation, yet infants may be ſaved without it.</p>
               <p>Your anſwer to our argument, <hi>that it is forbidden,</hi> is not worth taking notice of, <hi>what is not commanded in divine worſhip in any eſſentiall part of it, is forbidden, eſpecially there being rules ſet downe for ſome doing of it,</hi> and none for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:118462:84"/>
               <p>But (Sir) if you will doe any thing, anſwer my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formally, as you have it in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> p. 23, 24, 25 26, 27.</p>
               <p>You come to anſwer one of my arguments,<note place="margin">Page 67.</note> to prove preaching a proper act of the preachers office, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they may preach they may baptize,</hi> &amp;c. I gave two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, Math. 18.19. <hi>It is in the ſame commiſſion.</hi> 2. <hi>The Apoſtle maketh it rather the greater act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this now you pretend to anſwer and ſay, 1. <q>You deny the conſequence and collection, nor will that Text, <hi>1 Cor. 1.17.</hi> make it out, but ſeemes rather to hold forth the contrary.</q> Very well anſwered Sir, and with abundance of Reaſon: Secondly you ſay.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>2. The words Math. 18.19. I</hi> will be with you to the end, may as well be applyed to the doctrine as the perſons of the Apoſtles, and to thoſe who ſhall be wrought upon by that doctrine as the Apoſtles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What's this to the purpoſe, I plead the Commiſſion, you expound the promiſe. By this argument you prove they ſhould Baptize too, if the whole commiſſion extends to all Saints. You ſay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. You agree, <hi>that ſuch as teach by office may Baptize, but gifted brethren doe not teach by office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You adde to the Scripture (Sir,) <hi>by office</hi> is not in the Text, ſo that this is nothing to the purpoſe. You ſay,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <q>
                     <hi>4.</hi> You deny gifted Brethren have power to Baptize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never did, but they have power to preach, becauſe they ever did it and were never forbidden, but in effect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your baſe affirmings and denyings it are but <hi>poore emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty words,</hi> that come to no more then wind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they never did it, yet if they be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe it, they ought to take up their power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither did any of them not called to office, or extraordinarily gifted with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt now ceaſed in ordinary times, when the Church was not under perſecution, ever doe it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:118462:85"/>3. I have proved before they are forbidden, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded directly nor by conſequence. You tell us.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>
                     <hi>5. That you cannot agree, that</hi> preaching in a greater worke then baptiſme rightly done with preaching and prayer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No matter whether you agree it, or no, you ſhould doe well to prove that it is neceſſary that all Baptiſme follow or immediately goe before preaching; we grant it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, not neceſſary that Baptiſme be adminiſtred with Preaching, though you read of the Goſpell being Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, Acts 2. Acts 8. before the Baptizing of the 3000. and the Eunuch, yet you cannot prove I ſuppoſe that thoſe Sermons were intentionally preached in order to Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell how you will prove what you ſay here, that praying is a more ſpirituall worke then preaching, I am ſure neither in reſpect of the Subject, object, matter, or end, nor in reſpect of the right manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. You ſay,</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <q>
                     <hi>6. Grant it be the greater worke,</hi> it doth not follow, that becauſe the people may doe that, they may doe the leſſe, which is Baptiſme, for — if a commiſſion be granted to Commiſſioners to heare and determine leſſer offences.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. But Sir the people have no <hi>commiſſion</hi> granted them to preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> granted to perſons to heare and determine <hi>Treaſons and Felonies,</hi> I ſuppoſe it is a good argument to prove they may heare and determine the Felonies; becauſe they may heare and determine the Treaſons, and they are both in the ſame commiſſion. This is the caſe (Sir) Chriſt Jeſus hath granted commiſſion to certaine perſons to preach his Goſpell and Baptize, if you ſay and prove they may Preach. I will prove they may Baptize; why? they are both in the ſame Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerve that you ſay nothing to 1 Cor. 1.17.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118462:85"/> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſent him not to preach, but baptize.</hi> The words cannot be underſtood abſolutely, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> did baptize <hi>the houſhold of Stephanas,</hi> by his own confeſſion. The meaning muſt be, that he lookt upon preaching as his chiefe act as a Goſpel Officer. This you are not willing to take notice of.</p>

               <p>It is my brother <hi>Halls</hi> twelfth Argument, p. 26. <hi>edit.</hi> 1. and it is a good Argument, thus formd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The tree which conſtantly and naturally brings forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fruit, is a corrupt root.</hi> This is our Saviours Logicke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. not to be denied.</p>

                  <hi>But this principle and practice brings forth naturally very corrupt fruit.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.16.</p>

               <p>The Minor is proved by an induction of particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It confounds offices.</hi> 2. <hi>It breeds diſorder.</hi> 3. <hi>It opens a doore to errour.</hi> 4 <hi>It deſtroyes preaching in office,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. We ſay, <hi>Offices are uſurped and confounded by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you ſay nothing more then you ſaid before: that they doe not preach as officers; thats the ſubſtance of all, and the drift of your ſimilitudes from <hi>Bakers</hi> and <hi>Brewers</hi> comes to no more. We anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you cannot prove any preaching in Scripture, but what was an act of office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a man bake his own bread, or brew his own beere, I know none hath any thing to ſay to him; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he bakes for all will buy, what becomes of the bakers office then Sir? this is our caſe. But your ſimilitudes are generally miſerably lame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We told you before, Reading was no proper act of the Preachers office; and therefore you argue miſerably to ſay, becauſe peoples reading the Scripture doth not confound offices, therefore their preaching will not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To what you ſay, <hi>that theſe Ordinances rightly uſed may ſtand together,</hi> we anſwer, that we deſire you to prove their preaching publiquely to be an Ordinance, and then produce the Scriptures directing to the right uſe of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the Tryall you ſay is made, <hi>and no ſuch inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences appeare.</hi> We anſwer you in ſeverall places, ſuch hath appeared: aske the Churches in <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. I remember Sir, the Fable in <hi>Eſop,</hi> that the Snake did not preſently ſting him that took it into his boſome. Tell me ſome ſeven yeers hence.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond ill conſequence we charged it with, was <hi>"That all would then preach, and there would be diſorder,</hi> and God is the God of order.</p>
               <p>To this you ſay, <hi>That all never had, nor will have this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118462:86"/> guift.</hi> Yet you told us before, that all the Saints having the ſpirit dwelling in them, and this ſpirit being <hi>a ſpirit of Scripture interpretation, all have this guift, more or leſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>All are bound to exhort one another privately,</hi> and you lay much ſtrength upon that Argument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If all doe but think they have it, it is enough, who ſhall judge? You tell us,</p>

               <p>Beſides (Sir) is not order broke, when one body hath ten or twenty tongues, yea as many as <hi>Argus</hi> had eyes? the Apoſtle compares the Church to a body naturall; truly it ſhould not be all tongue.</p>

               <p>What's this to the purpoſe? (Sir) you dare not deny but there are errours and hereſies, Gal. 5.20 What if Papiſts and heretickes brand the Saints with thoſe names? are therefore none rightly ſo called? what thinke you (Sir) of <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Antitrinitarians,</hi> of ſuch as thinke, we are Godded, and there is no Angells, no Devills, no Heaven, no hell, read <hi>Jerrard Winſtanly</hi> his <hi>platforme of Freedome,</hi> dedicated to his Excellency, à p. 55. ad. p. 63. and tell me if you thinke him a Saint of God? yet there are not one or two, but one or two thouſand (rather) ſuch in <hi>England,</hi> moſt of which, if you enquire, you will I believe find either have been Preaching Brethren, or their hearers, and where ever they are met they have a Brother to preach to them; and defie a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpell, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>What then? muſt we therefore permit hereſies? or meanes directly tending to them, or would you infer from hence, that in order to this diſcovery gifted men ſhould be permitted to preach.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>You ſay,</hi> we might as well have reproach'd Chriſt and the Apoſtles, for Judas, Peter, Ananias, and Sapphira, Demas.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You are very unhappy (Sir) at making parallells, you tell us here of a Saint of God under a temptation, and a ſon of perdition and three profane wretches. 2.

               <p>This is truth (Sir) but to what purpoſe? hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, they that are led by the ſpirit neither lead others into errours, nor are led themſelves, but <hi>unlearned preachers doe both,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, 1. By denying the <hi>Minor;</hi> and you tell us <hi>there is a promiſe to a right hearing.</hi> Truth ſir, but this is not a right hearing, for <hi>how ſhall they heare without a preacher, and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent,</hi> Ro. 10.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>There was a bleſſing followed the preaching of "thoſe ſcattered upon the perſecution of Stephen,</hi> Acts 8.1, 4. Act. 11.21. I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. You are to prove, 1. <hi>That they were not in office.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they preached in a conſtituted Church ordinarily,</hi> when the people might heare ſuch as were in office. You will come ſhort in this proofe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is falſe that you ſay; <hi>we may as well ſay, there is no promiſe made to private teachings, and exhortings of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> They are commanded duties, which when rightly performed, have promiſes annexed conſtantly.</p>
               <p>In the next place you come to my brother <hi>Halls</hi> 17 Argument, p. 48. and my ſeventh, p. 46.</p>
               <p>My Argument was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is likely that that tenet which the Churches of Chriſt have in all ages rejected; and that practice which the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt in all ages have decried and avoyded, is not a truth of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Churches of Chriſt in all ages have rejected and decried this opinion and practice.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>Now let us heare what you ſay againſt this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>You are to live by Rule, not by example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Truth ſir, but you can ſhew us <hi>no Rule</hi> for you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is there any <hi>Rule that hath not been put in practice by ſome of the Churches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:118462:89"/>3. Where you can onely ſay, <hi>It is not directly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> not that it is abſolutely neceſſary. Example (Sir) if generall, or of the moſt, is not to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Surely the Apoſtle ſaid ſomething, when he ſaid, <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtoms, nor have the Churches of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16.</p>
               <p>You ſay <hi>it was not ſo in the primitive times.</hi> Prove that; <hi>"Nor ſo every where this day.</hi> What's that to the purpoſe? we have generally ſad examples in this age.</p>
               <p>We told you, <hi>That many of theſe Lay-preachers were ſuch "as denied Scripture ordinances, Duties, Obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Sabbaths, Faſtings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>None that are led by the Spirit doe ſo. They doe, it may be, "ſpeak againſt the abuſe of duties, and peoples reſting on them, and performing them carnall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, (notwithſtanding this ſhameleſſe inſinuation) we would have you know we are as much againſt, and preach as much againſt <hi>reſting in duties</hi> (that high idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) and carnall performance of them, as any others can or doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>None that are led by the Spirit doe ſo.</hi> But many guifted brethren doe ſo.—Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Again we ſay,</hi> For Magiſtracy, you appeale to all the world, who more alienate the peoples affections from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent governers, the preachers, or the guifted brethren.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whats this to the purpoſe? doe preachers in Office preach down Magiſtracy?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Any one is good when he is pleaſed. Suppoſe our Parliament ſhould forbid private perſons preaching; or ſeverely puniſh errours and hereſie; what would you do then? we can tell you when the guifted brethren were not ſuch friends to the Magiſtrates or Magiſtracy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What if ſome Miniſters (not all, Sir) were for a while unſatisfied in the late change? was there nothing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118462:90"/> in it (Sir) that might ſtartle a tender conſcience?</p>
               <p n="4">4. We believe that our Parliament doth, and in ſeven yeers time will more thinke them like to be beſt ſubjects who moſt <hi>feare an oath,</hi> and are moſt tender of doing any thing which might make an appearance of the breach of it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection you ſay we make is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"It is againſt Goſpel precepts and order.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.1, 22. Act. 13.3.</p>
               <p>You aime here I believe at my firſt Argument, p. 23. But you are ſo wiſe as not to put it in the forme I put it. To this you anſwer nothing, but Magiſterially deny it.</p>
               <p>A 13 Objection which you pretend to anſwer, is drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Let every one abide in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I think is one of my brother <hi>Halls</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>You anſwer, <hi>That guifted brethrens preaching is a piece of their generall calling.</hi> But (Sir) I have already proved, that publique preaching is a proper act of a particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and no ſuch act can be an act of our generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>A 14 Objection. <hi>This was to be committed to others,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. This is now a bit of my fourth Argument. (Sir) you are a ſhamefull diſputant. You ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat my Argument, and then deny a propoſition. But you tell us,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"That place is meant of the office of the Miniſtery, which you contend not for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truth (Sir) but you contend for a proper and chiefe Act of that office, as I have already proved. Whereas you ſay that the word is committed to the whole Church, 1 Tim. 3.15. I have anſwered that place before.</p>
               <p>In the next place you pretend to anſwer a fifteenth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is my fifth Argument, p. 40. of my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever may lawfully preach the Goſpell and interpret
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118462:90"/> Scriptures ordinarily, &amp;c. may warrantably require a maintenance competent for them, of thoſe to whom they ſo preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this guifted perſons cannot &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You grant the Minor, and tell me the Major is <hi>a Non ſequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You deny the plain words of the Apoſtle (Sir) 1 Tim. 5.18. <hi>They that rule well, are worthy of double honour,</hi> (coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and maintenance, viz.) <hi>eſpecially ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Matth. 10 10. 1 Tim. 5.18. Gal. 6.6. <hi>He that is taught in the Word is bound to communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Prove this is meant onely of ſuch as are in office.</p>
               <p>And then 2. <hi>That any are to preach that are not in office,</hi> or elſe you tell the holy Apoſtle his words are falſe.</p>
               <p>A 16 objection you pretend to anſwer is drawn from that of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 12 <q>Where the Apoſtle to ſhew that there ſhould be order kept in the Cburch of Chriſt, that one ſhould not be diſſatisfied at the excelling gift or office of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, compares the Church to a Naturall body, wherein are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Members, and all have their ſeverall offices, &amp;c. ſome eyes, ſome eares, &amp;c. and hence proves, that in the Church all ſhould not be eares, eyes, &amp;c. they ſhould not uſurpe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers places, nor envy one another for them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, <hi>Who denies this, or what have we "ſaid againſt this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You deny it (Sir) when you ſay God hath ordained all to be <hi>Tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A 17. Objection: <hi>Then women and boyes may preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You tell us: 1. <hi>Women might if they were not forbidden.</hi> I deny it, they muſt be commanded, or elſe they might not; this was the old Popiſh plea for ceremonies, they were lawfull becauſe not forbidden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay <hi>women did it,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. That place (Sir) is to be underſtood of being <hi>preſent at prophecying,</hi> or of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118462:91"/> 
                  <hi>extraordinary prophecying,</hi> or elſe the Apoſtle contradicts himſelfe in the ſame Epiſtle 1 Cor. 14.34. which I hope you dare not ſay.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>Boyes may if they have a gift,</hi> and to prove it you tell us Chriſt did, Lu. 2.46, and Timothy, 1 Tim. 4.42.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have put a pretty uncivill terme upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſurely they were no ordinary boyes (Sir) I perceive you have not read <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he would tell you there is <hi>a Juvenis aetate &amp; Moribus,</hi> young men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of age, or manners and abilities. You come to an</p>
               <p n="18">18. Object. <hi>This gift of opening and applying Scripture, "eſpecially hard places, was onely temporary and now ceaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>This you ſay</hi> (if true) were ſomething, but many have it at this day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay right (Sir) this is ſomething, and before you condemne it for falſe, anſwer the Reaſons to prove it <hi>extraordinary,</hi> which I have gathered out of ſeverall lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy men, and preſented you with in my <hi>Vindiciae Miniſterii,</hi> p. 50. 51. and when you have done that well, tell me what you thinke of men having that gift in theſe dayes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Object. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one of my Brother <hi>Halls</hi> arguments, and all you can ſay can never anſwer it, for it will not ſerve your turne to prove it is of faith, <hi>becauſe it is not ſpecially forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you tell us, <hi>it is warranted by Scripture,</hi> where (Sir?) this is all you will ſay to this argument, I believe it ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, and you made haſt to quit your hands of it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Object. <hi>There are two ordinances of Parliament in force againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this you grant</p>
               <p n="1">"1. That it is a <hi>practice reſtrainable by Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſee (Sir) how obedient our gifted Brethren are to Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:118462:91"/>2. You ſay <hi>Authority doth connive at it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Connivence (Sir) doth not fruſtrate publike acts nor warrant diſobedience to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But you hope in time the <hi>Parliament will repeale them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is poſſible, but if they doe not doe it till they finde them inconſiſtent with the lawes of Chriſt, they will be in force long enough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You grant it <hi>irregular and inconvenient</hi> for them to preach till <hi>authority doth command or allow it,</hi> then I ſee our Brethren though they may have the <hi>Spirit</hi> are not infallible, in their principles and practices they may be <hi>irregular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I cannot but obſerve how upon all occaſions, <hi>our brethren are more beholden to you then our God is:</hi> you grant Magiſtrates in this caſe, have power to command and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine, Ro. 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoule (ſaith the Apoſtle) be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers.</hi>—v. 2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the power reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and receiveth to himſelfe damnation,</hi> this is undoubtedly true of reſiſting <hi>true and lawfull powers in things which they may command and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine,</hi> yet you mince it prettily, <hi>not ſinfull and</hi> unlawful, but <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>inconvenient</hi> when it concerns the gifted brethren.</p>
               <p>I have now done to the doctrinall part of your Booke, and have proved your doctrine falſe.</p>
               <p>The Application (if ſuch as it ſhould be) muſt onely be the concluſion from theſe premiſes. I have denyed the premiſes, I need not deny the concluſion, I will only in one Chapter note a note or two.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Containing ſome ſhort notes upon Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> fourth Chatper, p. <hi>73.</hi> to the end of his Booke; Concluding with a ſhort application unto him.</head>
               <p n="1">1. YOu chide the preachers, p. 74. <hi>that they never preſſe upon the people</hi> their <hi>duty to interpret Scriptures,</hi> we muſt (Sir) firſt know it is their duty and not their ſinne, you goe on, p. 74. 75, 76. in ſome things ſcandalouſly aſperſing, in other things unwarrantably reproving the Miniſters, impertinently applying and ſhamefully wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Scriptures, and laſtly calling away our people from us as from <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev 18.34 —<hi>Bona verba quaeſo.</hi> As is a man,<note place="margin">P. 78.</note> ſo is his tongue, <hi>Cauſa infirma eſt ſemper querula,</hi> here's hard language enough (Sir) but your arguments before, and your ſenſe here, is as ſoft as a bulfiſt; Sir we hate Popiſh ſuperſtitions with as full an hatred as your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Then you turne to the gifted brethren, and give them eight wholeſome rules, againſt which I have nothing to ſay, but onely thinke there is one wanting, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they ſubmit themſelves to <hi>Examination and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> much elſe there is of good in the latter pages of your booke, but nothing argumentative.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here cloſe; I have not Sir (I thinke) aſperſed your perſon, you are a ſtranger to me, and (if I may judge by ſome things in your booke) one that profeſſeth much to the <hi>feare of God and the honour of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom I <hi>deſire to feare, and in whom</hi> alone is <hi>my hope,</hi> and whom I deſire to <hi>ſerve in my ſpirit;</hi> If I have made my ſelfe merry with your Logicke ſometimes.—<hi>Hanc veniam damus petimuſque viciſſim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you (Sir) by the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and by the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118462:92"/> 
                  <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeriouſly to weigh this thing, and to conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be any Goſpell precept or plaine preſident for this practiſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether there is not ground enough in Scripture to thinke this act of preaching a proper and reſtrained act, when as it is plainely betruſted to officers in ſo many Texts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether, theſe things conſidered, it can be an act of Faith in them to preach who are not ſo called?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether uſually ſuch preachers be not puft up with an opinion of their own parts?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether moſt of the hereſies and blaſphemies by which the precious name of our God is diſhonoured this day, be not branches from this root and ſtill maintained by it.</p>
               <p>And (Sir) let us not contend for <hi>Maſteries</hi> but for <hi>Truth.</hi> Can you thinke Sir that (as the polluted ſtate of <hi>Englands</hi> profeſſors now is) this is a way to reforme us? can a gifted brother convince a gaineſaying Socinian or Anabaptiſt, or Arminian thinke you? are not ſome of theſe in every corner of the Nation? Is not a gifted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more likely to be ſeduced by their ſubtilities, then to convince and oppoſe or anſwer? ſhall not the Goſpell of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer when a publike preacher of it ſhall turne his back upon an adverſary? (Deare Sir) I beſeech you by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt conſider theſe things, and take heed of pleading for <hi>Baal,</hi> no, <hi>let him plead for himſelfe;</hi> I beſeech you to peruſe Dr. <hi>Seamans</hi> Booke: Mr. <hi>Halls Pulpits guarded,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferribies</hi> anſwer to <hi>Collier,</hi> the Booke called <hi>Church Members ſet in j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will promiſe you a ſober reply. But (Deare Sir) ſtrive not for Maſteries <hi>Magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit,</hi> the great God and his truth ſhall one day conquer all.
